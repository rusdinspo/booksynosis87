One of its notable qualities is that it restores our temporal perspective. In doing so, it demonstrates the extraordinary flowering of the arts at the time the pyramids were built, when not only architecture, but sculpture. painting, and the decorative arts were at their peak.</p><p></p><h2>Louhi, Witch of North Farm</h2><p>A newly illustrated version of the classic Finnish tale recounts the saga of a troublesome witch who has stolen the sun and moon and locked them away behind the nine doors of Copper Mountain</p><p>Grade 1-4 Although at the beginning and at the end of this tale from the Kalevala, Louhi looks as harmless as a kitchen witch dangling by the cupboard, in between she steals the sun and moon and causes much mischief. The grandmotherly Louhi is a shape changer, at home knitting socks, comfortable as an eagle snatching the Earth's light. (Children who watch He-Man after school will readily accept this mixture of the heroic and the homey.) The story is nevertheless disappointing. The strong motivation and strong personalities of the epic are much diminished. Louhi steals the sun and moon casually, looking for "some Witch-Witch-Witchety things to do." The bard Vainamoinen is powerless to set things to right. Seppo, the smith, blusters more than actually shows his power. However, Cooney's provocative illustrationsmixed media, predominately acrylicswill carry most children beyond all this. A perfect winter stillness hangs in her snow pictures. The terrible darkness in her landscapes in which light no longer shines is a powerful reminder of the story's origin in Finland's national epic. Yet, if the artist in the reader is satisfied, the storyteller wishes for more. Anna Biagioni Hart, Sherwood Regional Library, Alexandria, Va.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this retelling of a story from the Kalevala (an epic poem), Louhi the Witch, who likes to make mischief, turns into an eagle and steals the sun and the moon out of the sky. She locks them up behind the nine iron doors of her storeroom, and the world is plunged into darkness. Vainamoinen, the Great Singer, the Great Knower, whose singing had caused the moon and the sun to come out, goes to see Louhi, but she frightens him away. Vainamoinen asks Seppo, the smith, to make a new sun and moon, but Seppo's efforts fail. Angrily, the smith forges an iron collar and nine "terrible" iron chains. Louhi, disguised as a hawk, hears of the chains, and hurries to release the sun and the moon. De Gerez's version of this is weak compared to the original, in which Louhi is not a witch on a farm but a female ruler of Pohjola, a powerful land in the north. But Cooney's pictures are splendidly detailed, and the spread of the dark world, in stark white on black, is a special shock after the previous abundance of color. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes By His Fool, Will Somers</h2><p>This book is about the life of Henry VIII who stopped at nothing to achieve his desires.</p><p>Praise for <i> The Autobiography of Henry VIII</i>: <p>"A remarkable achievement....

The heartbreak of war. The triumph of coming home. </b><br><br> 1940. Rural Wisconsin. Sixteen-year-old Earl &#x201c;Earwig&#x201d; Gunderman is not like other boys his age. Fiercely protected by his older brother, Earwig sees his town and the world around him through the prism of his own unique understanding. He sees his mother&#x2019;s sadness and his father&#x2019;s growing solitude. He sees his brother, Jimmy, falling in love with the most beautiful girl in town. And while Earwig is unable to make change for customers at his family&#x2019;s store, he is singularly well suited to understand what other people in his town cannot: that life as they know it is about to change; the coming war will touch them all. <br><br> For Jimmy will enlist in the military. And Earwig will watch his parents&#x2019; marriage buckle under the strain of a family secret.

His struggles to right the wrongs visited upon his revered older brother by war, women, and life are at once heartwarming and riotously funny. Their family and town irrevocably altered, Earwig and Jimmy fight to find their own places in a world changed forever.</p><p>Sandra Kring lives in the north woods of Wisconsin. She has run support groups and workshops for adult survivors of trauma. <i>Carry Me Home</i> is her first novel.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>Jimmy stands out by the oak tree next to the garage. He's turning in circles, all skittery-like. From my bedroom window I see the orange dot from his cigarette making streaks as he turns. I know if I don't hurry and get down there, he's gonna say piss on me, and leave. I walk real careful and put my ear against my door and it's cold. The door, not my ear. And I listen real good for Ma, but I don't hear nothing but for that loud whooshing you get in your ears when you're scared of getting caught climbing out your window.<br><br>I go back to the window&#x2014;the one I opened while the house was still all noisy with Glenn Miller, 'cause simpleminded or not, I ain't exactly a fool&#x2014;and I climb out real quiet-like. Them shingles feel like a cat's tongue against my hands as I scoot across the rooftop on my ass.<br><br>I get to the edge of the roof and drop down, my hands squeezing real tight, then I dangle there like a string of snot 'til Jimmy comes and gets ahold of my legs. He catches me, then drops me with a thud. "Crissakes, Earwig, you get any taller and you won't need me to catch you." Jimmy calls me "Earwig." He says it's 'cause I'm like one of those bugs that crawls in a guy's ear and goes right to his brain, making him go crazy. Jimmy reaches up and rubs his knuckles over my hair that is turd-brown and grows straight up like quack grass, then he grabs our fishing gear and off we go down the sidewalk.<br><br>Jimmy whistles as we go down them empty, dark streets to get to Louie's house. Jimmy's car is in the garage, the motor all ripped to shit, so Louie's gonna drive his car to the millpond, where we're gonna spear suckers and drink beers. Jimmy's real nice to let me come along. Ain't many brothers who'd take their sixteen-year-old, dumb-as-a-stump brother to fish and drink beers with 'em. But Jimmy's always letting me tag along. He knows I ain't got friends like he's got, 'cept for Eddie, and he don't count 'cause he's only six years old, fat as a Thanksgiving turkey, and maybe even dumber than me.<br><br>Louie's coming outta the garage with his creel when we get there, his orange, frazzly hair looking like fire with the porch light shining on it. John is leaned up against Louie's car, smoking a cigarette, and Floyd, he is standing there kicking up gravel with his shoe, his shoulders all drooped forward, like they always is.<br><br>"You took long enough, Gunderman," John says, and Jimmy says to him, "Ah, give it a rest, Pissfinger." I don't call John Pissfinger like the rest of the gang does, on accounta I know if I do, he's probably gonna stick his boot so far up my ass I'll gag on his shoelaces.<br><br>We all whoop and holler as we pull outta the driveway, spitting gravel.<br><br>"Serve 'em up, Earwig," Jimmy says. I reach under the seat to fetch the bottles of Schlitz that are clinking and clanking there. I pry a cap with the opener I got dangling from my belt, slip the cap into my pocket, and hand the first bottle to Louie. It's the rule: The number-one guy gets the first beer, and usually, whoever's got a car that's running is the number-one guy.<br><br>All the way to the millpond, them guys talk about titties, beers, and whose asses they're gonna kick. Jimmy's the only one of them guys that can really kick anybody's ass. Jimmy ain't real tall, but he's got muscles pert' near as big as Captain Midnight's, and like John says, Jimmy knows how to use his fists when he's gotta. I tell 'em I know a few asses I'd like to kick, and Jimmy tells me to shut up or he's gonna fart in my face. I know he will too, so I shut up.<br><br>Them trees along the road to the millpond look like butt-naked skinny girls against the sky that's bright from a fat moon. Jimmy told me once that them fat circle moons remind him of a big, white titty. Course, he thinks everything looks like a titty.<br><br>We turn off Mill Street and head down the dirt road that goes to the millpond. Louie drives so fast over the bumps that I bang my head on the roof.<br><br>Louie jams on the brakes and we stop real fast. Beer slops down the front of John's shirt and he pisses and moans about it like he's going to the town hall for a fancy-up dance instead of grubbing for suckers at the millpond.<br><br>We stand on the bank and rip our shoes and socks off. I know damn well it's gonna be cold as shit in that rushing water, the snow here in Wisconsin not being gone all that long when them suckers start wriggling upriver looking for a place to drop their eggs. We're all laughing and joking and having a good time. Ain't nothing more fun than spearing suckers with Jimmy and the guys.<br><br>"Hey, Earwig," John says, as he balls up a sock and throws it at me. "I hear you tried choppin' off Edna Pritchard's fat leg." Floyd and Louie start to laughing. I talk real loud so John can hear me above the laughing and the whooshing of the water. "I wasn't trying to chop her leg off. That's the God's honest truth."<br><br>"That's right," Jimmy says, talking all mumbled 'cause he's got a Camel sticking outta the corner of his mouth. "He wasn't trying to cut off her leg, he was trying to measure her fat ass." This makes them laugh all the harder.<br><br>"Tell us the story, Earwig," Floyd says, so I tell 'em. I tell 'em how Dad said, right there at the table while buttering a piece of nut bread Mrs. Pritchard brought, that that Edna Pritchard has the biggest ass he ever see'd on a woman. Dad said, "That ass has got to be at least three ax handles wide."<br><br>"Well, that didn't sound right to me," I tell the guys, and it didn't. "Mrs. Pritchard has a fat ass, sure as my name's Earl Hedwig Gunderman, but three ax handles wide, that just didn't sound right to me. So I wait 'til I hear her big mouth yapping in the store, then I go out to the woodpile real fast and I fetch myself the ax. Then I go back into the store, whistling so as no one thinks I'm up to something, and I start taggin' after Mrs. Pritchard. Ma and her was talking about that Dickens girl getting polio and what a pity it will be if her legs get all crippled, and how, worse yet, if that little girl dies, her mama's heart's gonna cripple up too and she'll die right along with her. Mrs. Pritchard is looking at cans of applesauce while she talks, 'cause she's gonna make some gingerbread and Mr. Pritchard won't eat gingerbread unless it's got applesauce poured over the top."<br><br>"Crissakes," Jimmy says as he roots around in our stuff for a spear, "get to the goddamn point of the story, Earwig," but he ain't mad when he says it, 'cause he's laughing.<br><br>"Well," I tell 'em, "I go'ed up behind Mrs. Pritchard, holding that ax like this," and I show 'em how I holded it, sideways like, right behind her fat ass. "And it sure is a fat ass," I say, and Floyd holds his skinny guts that are sunk in like a bowl and asks how would I like to hose that fat ass, and I say I wouldn't like that at all. Jimmy says, "The story, Earwig, get to the point of the goddamn story."<br><br>So I go on with the story. I tell 'em how I was holding that ax up crossways, following behind her, and how when she walks, her ass under that dress looks like two bulls fighting under a sheet of mill felt.<br><br>"Then Ma looks up and sees me behind Mrs. Pritchard, who ain't so far seeing nothing but that can of applesauce in her hand, and Ma yells, 'Earl Hedwig Gunderman, what on earth are you doing with that ax?' and Mrs. Pritchard starts to turn and she sees me holding that ax, and she starts to screaming. I get all scared 'cause her scream is as big as her ass, and that ax falls right outta my hands, just as her fat legs are turning her around." Floyd is slapping the ground with his hand, laughing real hard.<br><br>I turn to Louie, who is laughing too, but not so hard he can't hear me. "You ever see an ax fall, Louie? It don't fall flat and nice at all. That cutting part, it falls first, making it look like a ghost is fixing to split a chunk of wood. And that ax come right down on Mrs. Pritchard's fat ankle."<br><br>Jimmy is laughing 'til he's choking out, "Cut through her fat almost right down to the bone!" Floyd laughs 'til his dark hair is slapping his forehead like a horse's tail. "Ol' Fat Ass starts hopping around like she's got a rat trying to crawl up the crack of her ass, and Earwig here goes nuts like he always does when he gets rattled. He starts slapping the sides of his head, almost knocking himself out. Then Pritchard really loses it." They're all in stitches now, only I'm starting to think it ain't so goddamn funny. Ain't nothing funny about blood, all red and shiny, spewing out of somebody's fat ankle.<br><br>Jimmy shakes his head. "Ma starts in with her 'Oh, good Lord! Oh, good Lord!' And she runs to fetch a towel, then gets down on all fours, trying to get that towel slung around Pritchard's ankle to stop the bleeding. That Pritchard was going nuts, yelling that Earwig had tried to kill her, and Ma was going nuts, screaming at me to go get Dr. McCormick. I had to leave then, so I missed the rest of that freak show."<br><br>Them guys start joking about how I shoulda chopped a chunk of her ass off while I was at it, but I ain't listening too hard to 'em now. I'm trying to get Mrs. Pritchard's words outta my head. Them words, "You should have locked that boy up long ago, Eileen."<br><br>Ma didn't make me mop up that blood that was already seeping into the cracks of the floor, turning it all dark by the time Dr. McCormick come and took Mrs. Pritchard back in the kitchen to stitch her fat back together. Ma, she came back into the store with a pail of soapy water and started scrubbing with a bunched rag. She made me stand right there, where she could keep an eye on me. She sounded all winded, like she'd just run all the way down Main Street and back without stopping, as she preached at me about minding my Ps and Qs and not scaring people.<br><br>"So," John asks after he lights his Lucky Strike, "how many ax handles wide is the old bag's ass, anyway, Earwig?"<br><br>"Well, I didn't exactly get to finish measuring it," I tell him, "but I got as far as knowing it's more than one ax handle wide, that's for sure."<br><br>I'm real glad when the guys get done laughing and go back to talking about titties and kicking ass.<br><br>I go to the trunk of Louie's car to get the bucket we use for keeping the beer cold. I take that bucket and dig the rest of those Schlitz bottles out from under the seat and put them in the bucket. Then I bring the bucket to the groove in the bank that Louie cut out, leaving a little ditch so the water fills up the hole some. I put water in the pail and I set the pail in that little ditch.<br><br>While I do this, Floyd and John are getting some wood for the little fire that Jimmy's leaning over, huffing into the thick smoke to get the flames sparking.<br><br>When we get everything all set up perfect-like, Jimmy hands me a spear, reminding me to stay on them flat rocks in the shallow part. Jimmy knows I can't swim for shit. The guys head upstream, laughing as they slosh through the water, their arms pumping, each of 'em taking turns bitching about how cold the water is.<br><br>The water looks like silver coins swirling in beer foam. I steady myself on a rock and stare real hard through them swirls. I wait for a dark shadow to come along, 'cause that would be one of them suckers. Suckers are ugly critters if I ever see'd one, with scales big as fingernails, and round mouths that move like an asshole trying to squeeze out a turd. Them suckers are mighty ugly, but after Louie sets 'em up in his smokehouse for a time, they end up tasting mighty damn good.<br><br>I see one, not far from my feet, and I stab my spear as hard as I can. It don't go into the fish, though. It just bangs against the rock I'm standing on, then skids sideways. I do a little dance to keep that spearhead from kicking up against my foot. Upstream, I can hear the guys and I can tell from their yelling that they're gonna come back with their creels stuffed.<br><br>I get real busy then, listening to some noise in the brush, hoping it ain't no bear. I'm scared shitless of bears 'cause I know if one starts wailing on me, there's gonna be lots of blood. And while I'm watching for bears, I'm jabbing my spear into the water any which way, and it keeps clanking against the rocks. Then, about the time Floyd calls out that it's time for a beer break before they all freeze their balls off, I stab my spear into the water and it hits something tender. That handle starts dancing all over in my hands, and I can feel that I got a pissed-off sucker stuck at the other end. "Jimmy! Jimmy!" I shout, real loud.<br><br>"You got one, Earwig?" Jimmy shouts back, all excited.<br><br>I can't talk, 'cause I'm excited as shit. I don't know what to do, so I don't do nothing 'cept keep dancing on that rock and hanging tight to the spear that's still bucking in my hands.<br><br>Jimmy kicks water up on me as he jumps to the rock I'm standing on. "Jesus Christ, Earwig, you gonna stand there pissing yourself, or are you gonna pull it up?"<br><br>I ain't gonna piss, but Louie is. He's in the water, his pecker out, and he's about to start pissing. Excited or not, I know I don't want Louie's piss getting on my fish, so I lift that spear up. And there it is, a big-ass sucker, wiggling and squirming 'cause he's got two tines stuck through his back. Even though it's mostly dark, I can see blood, black and shiny, running down the sides of that poor fish.</p><h2>Tell Me about Salvation (Train &#39;Em Up)</h2><p>Train &#x2019;Em Up is an interactive, fun-filled, and affordable series that uses a train locomotive theme for teaching kids core Christian beliefs and principles.

He lives in Washington, D.C.Last year marked the centenary of the zipper, or at least of the date on which the US Government granted Whitcomb L. Judson two basic patents for this exemplary bit of Yankee ingenuity. In honor of the occasion, Friedel (History/Univ. of Maryland) has stitched together an uncommonly engaging account of how a technological curiosity became a ubiquitous, all-purpose fastener that now touches many, if not most, lives. The zipper traveled a long road from drawing board to marketplace and yielded its inventor precious few rewards. At the outset, in fact, it was a solution in search of a problem. Though sustained by the lonely passion of Lewis Walker, founder of the Hookless Fastener Co. (HFC), the zipper did not become a commercial success until the mid-1930s, when clothiers followed the lead of high-fashion designers like Schiaparelli and began incorporating slide fasteners in popularly priced apparel. Nor did the zipper make a name for itself; the word was coined (and trademarked) in 1925 by B.F. Goodrich for a short-lived line of galoshes. Engineering setbacks and price resistance apart, the author argues, the zipper has never ranked among life's basic necessities. Buttons, clasps, laces, and other contrivances, he points out, can still handle virtually any of its applications. Even so, Friedel recounts, the two-track closure has become a near universal artifact--and more. By way of example, he cites the zipper's centerpiece role in urban legend and modern literature, most notably, perhaps, Erica Jong's riffs on the pleasures of ``the zipless fuck.'' In the meantime, Talon Inc. (HFC's corporate name since 1937) twice lost its independence after WW II, most recently to Coats Viyella plc, a British multinational. The only evidence that the firm was once an economic mainstay of Meadville, Pa., lies in the local radio station's call letters--WZPR. A nicely calculated blend of cultural and business perspectives.

Readers acquainted with gay history will be on familiar ground here, since Castle (English/Stanford; the scholarly Masquerade and Civilization, 1986, etc.) includes the likes of Greta Garbo, The Bostonians, and The Well of Loneliness among her subjects. Her thesis is that lesbians have been ``ghosted''--made into apparitions, visible but not quite present--throughout history, and she finds numerous examples of homosexual women being described as ``spectral'' or, like The Well of Loneliness's Stephen Gordon, as ``earthbound spirits.'' Castle's ``ghosting'' looks suspiciously like a fancier wording for the well-explored phenomenon of ``lesbian invisibility,'' but the author (who's openly gay) infuses new life into the concept by underlining various characters' feistiness and ``gaiety'' rather than their victimization. But Castle often reads too much between the lines: One would never guess that The New Yorker's Janet Flanner was a lesbian simply by studying her articles. Moreover, she sometimes misreads other historians or literary critics: Lillian Faderman's claim, for instance, that the 19th-century English Ladies of Llangollen lacked a ``lesbian consciousness'' somehow becomes a straw man that the author dubs the ``no-sex-before-1900 school.'' But Castle's forte- -the use of examples from her own life--underlines her points and makes her concluding chapter, ``In Praise of Brigitte Fassbaender (A Musical Emanation),'' her best, as she deftly mixes autobiographical revelation and literary theory while analyzing female fans of operatic divas, in a kind of lesbian equivalent of Wayne Koestenbaum's The Queen's Throat. Not groundbreaking, but Castle's blend of solid research and clear, accessible prose may win her an enthusiastic readership. (Thirty illustrations) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>With the recent explosion in the number of gay and lesbian fiction titles, it should come as no surprise that next would follow a spate of similar studies from academia. Here is yet another. Castle (English, Stanford) decodes the ciphers of our culture to find the "apparitional lesbian" everywhere haunting our history, literature, and music. From essays on Marie Antoinette as the patron saint of lesbianism to the alluring "homovocality" of mezzo-soprano Brigitte Fassbaender, Castle describes how the dominant straight culture has portrayed the lesbian over the past 300 years. One might argue with some of her assumptions, for example, that lesbian desire only emerges in the absence of male bonding. Overall, however, Castle's acute observational powers present an insightful overview of early 20th-century lesbian fiction, and her incisive historical perspective presents a fascinating study of the haunted presence of the lesbian throughout Western literary history in general. Informative and thought-provoking, her book is highly recommended for academic libraries and larger collections with interested lay readers.<br><i>- Jeffery Ingram, Newport P.L., Ore.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Maples in the Mist: Children&#39;s Poems from the Tang Dynasty</h2><p>A collection of short poems written over 1000 years ago by such poets of the Tang Dynasty as Li Po, Yin Luan, and Du Mu</p><p>Grade 3 Up?A beautiful anthology of 16 short, unrhymed poems written 1000 years ago in China. Although the poems Ho has chosen reflect timeless themes and her translations are fresh and informal, most are too introspective for a young Western audience. An attentive fourth-grader might relate to "On the Pond," in which two boys foolishly leave a trail betraying their mischief, or "Goose," a straightforward observation of a paddling goose, humorously illustrated. But the metaphoric images of a rainstorm en route to ancestors' gravesites, an empty boat tossed in a twilight storm, birds in flight against the vastness of time and space, and even homesickness ("How can a blade of young grass/ever repay the warmth of the spring sun?") seem a bit sophisticated for pre-teens. In her introduction, Ho admits she memorized these poems reluctantly in childhood, coming to appreciate them only years later. Even young children, however, will enjoy the illustrations that complement the lean, moody text. The Tsengs' watercolors are reminiscent of traditional T'ang brush-paintings. Stylized contours of huts and pagodas, birds, blossoms, and children in ancient dress are set in airy, expressive washes of landscape, spring or autumn foliage, and mountains floating in the mist. Chinese characters printed in the right and left margins of each page are offered, unfortunately, without explanation. The three-page appendix, "About the Poets," is a useful lead-in to further research on the 14 men and their work.?Karen L.

If you had the <i>Scholastic Children's Thesaurus</i>, you'd flip through it until you found "nice" between "new" and "noise." Then you'd find your options: "pleasant," "agreeable," "good-natured," "delightful," and "fantastic" (defined as "extremely nice or good!"). Nearby, a color bar warns, "Nice is a very general word to describe someone you like or something that makes you feel good, but it is not very specific. Be careful not to overuse it. Often a stronger or more specific word is better." At this point, you might be rolling your eyes because your teacher already said all that, but you'll be a more pleasant, agreeable, good-natured, delightful, and fantastic writer for your efforts! <p> John K. Bollard's thesaurus, playfully illustrated by Mike Reed, contains more than 500 main "headwords" and 2,500 synonyms, but if you can't find the word you're looking for--"energetic," for example--you can flip to the index in the back where you'll find "Energetic--See Lively." Lively leads you to "active," "energetic," and "vigorous." All synonyms include a definition as well as one or more sample sentences.

From records that do exist, we can surmise that from very early times, needleworkers used the crudest of materials and tools to create utilitarian pieces that are today considered to be works of needle art. Within the realm of needlework lies sampler-making. While the earliest surviving example of what is believed to be a sampler from the early Nazca culture dates to between A.D.200 and 500, sampler-making&#39;s recognized history dates from approximately the sixteenth century forward. The making of samplers in times past provided a means by which a young lady learned the alphabet and numerals. But much more importantly, it taught her the needle skills she was required to master in order to be considered suitable for marriage. One of her primary responsibilities was to mend, tend and mark the linens and clothing needed for a household. Sampler stitchers of modern times enjoy sampler-making as a pleasurable hobby. While many of us ply the stitches to re-create masterworks from the past, we also have an incredible array of contemporary work from which to choose. The appeal for some may be simply to create beautiful, decorative pieces for their homes. For others, however, their pastime also serves to educate them to the art of the needle while stimulating interest in its origins. For those individuals, existing samplers from days gone by offer not only a glimpse at the techniques that were used to execute them but also a look at the times in which they were created. They speak to the morals and values of their times, as well as to the political and educational influences that affected entire cultures....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Carrion Comfort</h2><p>Carrion Comfort penetrates the darkest recesses of the 20th century, as one man seeks to justify his belief that a secret society of powerful beings is behind many of the world&#39;s most horrific catastrophes.

I thought that was in very bad taste. She had her scrapbook laid out on my mahogany coffee table, newspaper clippings neatly arranged in chronological order, the bald statements of death recording all of her Feedings. Nina Drayton&#x2019;s smile was as radiant as ever, but her pale blue eyes showed no hint of warmth.</p> <p>&#x201c;We should wait for Willi,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course, Melanie. You&#x2019;re right, as always. How silly of me. I know the rules.&#x201d; Nina stood and began walking around the room, idly touching the furnishings or exclaiming softly over a ceramic statuette or piece of needlepoint. This part of the house had once been the conservatory, but now I used it as my sewing room. Green plants still caught the morning light. The sunlight made it a warm, cozy place in the daytime, but now that winter had come the room was too chilly to use at night. Nor did I like the sense of darkness closing in against all those panes of glass.</p> <p>&#x201c;I love this house,&#x201d; said Nina. She turned and smiled at me. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you how much I look forward to coming back to Charleston. We should hold all of our reunions here.&#x201d;</p> <p>I knew how much Nina loathed this city, this house.</p> <p>&#x201c;Willi would be hurt,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know how he likes to show off his place in Beverly Hills. And his new girlfriends.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And boyfriends,&#x201d; said Nina and laughed. Of all the changes and darkenings in Nina, her laugh has been least affected. It was still the husky but childish laugh that I had first heard so long ago. It had drawn me to her then&#x2014;one lonely, adolescent girl responding to the warmth of another like a moth to a flame. Now it only served to chill me and put me even more on my guard. Enough moths had been drawn to Nina&#x2019;s flame over the many decades.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send for tea,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>Mr. Thorne brought the tea in my best Wedgwood china. Nina and I sat in the slowly moving squares of sunlight and spoke softly of nothing important; mutually ignorant comments on the economy, references to books which the other had not got around to reading, and sympathetic murmurs about the low class of persons one meets while flying these days. Someone peering in from the garden might have thought they were seeing an aging but attractive niece visiting her favorite aunt. (I draw the line at suggesting that anyone would mistake us for mother and daughter.) People usually consider me a well-dressed if not stylish person. Heaven knows I have paid enough to have the wool skirts and silk blouses mailed from Scotland and France. But next to Nina I always felt dowdy. This day she wore an elegant, light blue dress which must have cost several thousand dollars if I had identified the designer correctly. The color made her complexion seem even more perfect than usual and brought out the blue of her eyes. Her hair had gone as gray as mine, but somehow she managed to get away with wearing it long and tied back with a single barrette. It looked youthful and chic on Nina and made me feel that my short, artificial curls were glowing with a blue rinse.</p> <p>Few would suspect that I was four years younger than Nina. Time had been kind to her. And she had Fed more often.</p> <p>She set down her cup and saucer and moved aimlessly around the room again. It was not like Nina to show such signs of nervousness. She stopped in front of the glass display case. Her gaze passed over the Hummels, the pewter pieces, and then stopped in surprise.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good heavens, Melanie. A pistol! What an odd place to put an old pistol.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an heirloom,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Quite expensive. And you&#x2019;re right, it is a silly place to keep it. But it&#x2019;s the only case I have in the house with a lock on it and Mrs. Hodges often brings her grandchildren when she visits&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You mean it&#x2019;s loaded?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, of course not,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;But children should not play with such things&#x2026;&#x201d; I trailed off lamely. Nina nodded but did not bother to conceal the condescension in her smile. She went to look out the south window into the garden.</p> <p>Damn her. It said volumes about Nina Drayton that she did not recognize that pistol.</p> <p>On the day he was killed, Charles Edgar Larchmont had been my beau for precisely five months and two days. There had been no formal announcement, but we were to be married. Those five months had been a microcosm of the era itself&#x2014;naive, flirtatious, formal to the point of preciosity, and romantic. Most of all romantic. Romantic in the worst sense of the word; dedicated to saccharine or insipid ideals that only an adolescent&#x2014;or an adolescent society&#x2014;would strive to maintain. We were children playing with loaded weapons.</p> <p>Nina, she was Nina Hawkins then, had her own beau&#x2014;a tall, awkward, but well-meaning Englishman named Roger Harrison. Mr. Harrison had met Nina in London a year earlier during the first stages of the Hawkins&#x2019;s Grand Tour. Declaring himself smitten&#x2014;another absurdity of those childish times&#x2014;the tall Englishman had followed her from one European capital to another until, after being firmly reprimanded by Nina&#x2019;s father (an unimaginative little milliner who was constantly on the defensive about his doubtful social status), Harrison returned to London to &#x201c;settle his affairs&#x201d; only to show up some months later in New York just as Nina was being packed off to her aunt&#x2019;s home in Charleston in order to terminate yet another flirtation. Still undaunted, the clumsy Englishman followed her south, ever mindful of the protocols and restrictions of the day.</p> <p>We were a gay group. The day after I met Nina at Cousin Celia&#x2019;s June Ball, the four of us were taking a hired boat up the Cooper River for a picnic on Daniel Island. Roger Harrison, serious and solemn on every topic, was a perfect foil for Charles&#x2019;s irreverent sense of humor. Nor did Roger seem to mind the good-natured jesting since he was soon joining in the laughter with his peculiar haw-haw-haw.</p> <p>Nina loved it all. Both gentlemen showered attention on her and while Charles never failed to show the primacy of his affection for me, it was understood by all that Nina Hawkins was one of those young women who invariably becomes the center of male gallantry and attention in any gathering. Nor were the social strata of Charleston blind to the combined charm of our foursome. For two months of that now distant summer, no party was complete, no excursion adequately planned, and no occasion considered a success unless we four merry pranksters were invited and had chosen to attend. Our happy dominance of the youthful social scene was so pronounced that Cousins Celia and Loraine wheedled their parents into leaving two weeks early for their annual August sojourns in Maine.</p> <p>I am not sure when Nina and I came up with the idea of the duel. Perhaps it was during one of the long, hot nights when the other &#x201c;slept over&#x201d;&#x2014;creeping into the other&#x2019;s bed, whispering and giggling, stifling our laughter when the rustling of starched uniforms betrayed the presence of our colored maids moving through the darkened halls. In any case, the idea was the natural outgrowth of the romantic pretensions of the time. The picture of Charles and Roger actually dueling over some abstract point of honor related to us thrilled both of us in a physical way which I recognize now as a simple form of sexual titillation.</p> <p>It would have been harmless except for our Ability. We had been so successful in our manipulation of male behavior&#x2014;a manipulation which was both expected and encouraged in those days&#x2014;that neither of us had yet suspected that there lay anything beyond the ordinary in the way we could translate our whims into other people&#x2019;s actions. The field of parapsychology did not exist then: or rather, it existed only in the rappings and knockings of parlor game s�ances. At any rate, we amused ourselves with whispered fantasies for several weeks and then one of us&#x2014;or perhaps both of us&#x2014;used the Ability to translate the fantasy into reality.</p> <p>In a sense it was our first Feeding.</p> <p>I do not remember the purported cause of the quarrel, perhaps some deliberate misinterpretation of one of Charles&#x2019;s jokes. I can not recall who Charles and Roger arranged to have serve as seconds on that illegal outing. I do remember the hurt and confused expression on Roger Harrison&#x2019;s face during those few days. It was a caricature of ponderous dullness, the confusion of a man who finds himself in a situation not of his making and from which he cannot escape. I remember Charles and his mercurial swings of mood&#x2014;the bouts of humor, periods of black anger, and the tears and kisses the night before the duel.</p> <p>I remember with great clarity the beauty of that morning. Mists were floating up from the river and diffusing the rays of the rising sun as we rode out to the dueling field. I remember Nina reaching over and squeezing my hand with an impetuous excitement that was communicated through my body like an electric shock.</p> <p>Much of the rest of that morning is missing. Perhaps in the intensity of that first, subconscious Feeding I literally lost consciousness as I was engulfed in the waves of fear, excitement, pride&#x2026;of maleness&#x2026;that was emanating from our two beaus as they faced death on that lovely morning. I remember experiencing the shock of realizing this is really happening as I shared the tread of high boots through the grass. Someone was calling off the paces. I dimly recall the weight of the pistol in my hand&#x2026;Charles&#x2019;s hand I think, I will never know for sure&#x2026;and a second of cold clarity before an explosion broke the connection and the acrid smell of gunpowder brought me back to myself.</p> <p>It was Charles who died. I have never been able to forget the incredible quantities of blood which poured from the small, round hole in his breast. His white shirt was crimson by the time I reached him. There had been no blood in our fantasies. Nor had there been the sight of Charles with his head lolling, mouth dribbling saliva onto his bloodied chest while his eyes rolled back to show the whites like two eggs embedded in his skull. Roger Harrison was sobbing as Charles breathed his final, shuddering gasps on that field of innocence.</p> <p>I remember nothing at all about the confused hours which followed. It was the next morning that I opened my cloth bag to find Charles&#x2019;s pistol lying with my things. Why would I have kept that revolver? If I had wished to take something from my fallen lover as a sign of remembrance, why that alien piece of metal? Why pry from his dead fingers the symbol of our thoughtless sin?</p> <p>It said volumes about Nina that she did not recognize that pistol.</p> <p>&#x201c;Willi&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was not Mr. Thorne announcing the arrival of our guest but Nina&#x2019;s &#x201c;amanuensis,&#x201d; the loathsome Miss Barrett Kramer. Kramer&#x2019;s appearance was as unisex as her name; short cropped, black hair, powerful shoulders, and a blank, aggressive gaze which I associated with lesbians and criminals. She looked to be in her mid-thirties.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you, Barrett, dear,&#x201d; said Nina.</p> <p>I went to greet Willi, but Mr. Thorne had already let him in and we met in the hallway.</p> <p>&#x201c;Melanie! You look marvelous! You grow younger each time I see you. Nina!&#x201d; The change in Willi&#x2019;s voice was evident. Men continued to be overpowered by their first sight of Nina after an absence. There were hugs and kisses. Willi himself looked more dissolute than ever. His alpaca sports coat was exquisitely tailored, his turtleneck sweater successfully concealed the eroded lines of his wattled neck, but when he swept off his jaunty sportscar cap the long strands of white hair he had brushed forward to hide his encroaching baldness were knocked into disarray. Willi&#x2019;s face was flushed with excitement, but there was also the telltale capillary redness about the nose and cheeks which spoke of too much liquor, too many drugs.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ladies, I think you&#x2019;ve met my associates&#x2026;Tom Reynolds and Jensen Luhar?&#x201d; The two men added to the crowd in my narrow hall. Mr. Reynolds was thin and blond, smiling with perfectly capped teeth. Mr. Luhar was a gigantic Negro, hulking forward with a sullen, bruised look on his coarse face. I was sure that neither Nina nor I had encountered these specific catspaws of Willi&#x2019;s before.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we go into the parlor?&#x201d; I suggested. It was an awkward procession ending with the three of us seated on the heavily upholstered chairs surrounding the Georgian tea table which had been my grandmother&#x2019;s. &#x201c;More tea, please, Mr. Thorne.&#x201d; Miss Kramer took that as her cue to leave, but Willi&#x2019;s two pawns stood uncertainly by the door, shifting from foot to foot and glancing at the crystal on display as if their mere proximity could break something. I would not have been surprised if that had proven to be the case.</p> <p>&#x201c;Jensen!&#x201d; Willi snapped his fingers. The Negro hesitated and then brought forward an expensive leather attach� case. Willi set it on the tea table and clicked the catches open with his short, broad fingers. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you two see Miz Fuller&#x2019;s man about getting something to drink?&#x201d;</p> <p>When they were gone Willi shook his head and smiled at Nina. &#x201c;Sorry about that, love.&#x201d;</p> <p>Nina put her hand on Willi&#x2019;s sleeve. She leaned forward with an air of expectancy. &#x201c;Melanie wouldn&#x2019;t let me begin the Game without you. Wasn&#x2019;t that awful of me to want to start without you, Willi dear?&#x201d;</p> <p>Willi frowned. After fifty years he still bridled at being called Willi. In Los Angeles he was Big Bill Borden. When he returned to his native Germany&#x2014;which was not often because of the dangers involved&#x2014;he was once again Wilhelm von Borchert, lord of dark manor, forest, and hunt. But Nina had called him Willi when they had first met in 1925, in Vienna, and Willi he had remained.</p> <p>&#x201c;You begin, Willi,&#x201d; said Nina. &#x201c;You go first.&#x201d;</p> <p>I could remember the time when we would have spent the first few days of our reunion in conversation and catching up with each other&#x2019;s lives. Now there was not even time for small talk.</p> <p>Willi showed his teeth and removed news clippings, notebooks, and a stack of cassettes from his briefcase. No sooner had he covered the small table with his material than Mr. Thorne arrived with the tea and Nina&#x2019;s scrapbook from the sewing room. Willi brusquely cleared a small space.</p> <p>At first glance one might see certain similarities between Willi Borchert and Mr. Thorne. One would be mistaken. Both men tend to the florid, but Willi&#x2019;s complexion was the result of excess and emotion: Mr. Thorne had known neither of these for many years. Willi&#x2019;s balding was a patchy, self-consciously concealed thing&#x2014;a weasel with the mange&#x2014;while Mr. Thorne&#x2019;s bare head was smooth and unwrinkled. One could not imagine Mr. Thorne ever having had hair. Both men had gray eyes&#x2014;what a novelist would call cold, gray eyes&#x2014;but Mr. Thorne&#x2019;s eyes were cold with indifference, cold with a clarity coming from an absolute absence of troublesome emotion or thought. Willi&#x2019;s eyes were the cold of a blustery North Sea winter and were often clouded with shifting curtains of the emotions that controlled him&#x2014;pride, hatred, love of pain, the pleasures of destruction. Willi never referred to his use of the Ability as Feedings&#x2014;I was evidently the only one who thought in those terms&#x2014;but Willi sometimes talked of the Hunt. Perhaps it was the dark forests of his homeland that he thought of as he stalked his human quarry through the sterile streets of Los Angeles. Did Willi dream of the forest? I wondered.

Through individual interviews with over 50 artists, <em>Artless</em> looks at how and why these particular artists find the intimate connection between the unassuming tools they use and the art thus created so enthralling. For creator and viewer alike there seems to be a particular kind of pleasure to be had in short-circuiting the sophisticated and often elusive strategies of contemporary art in favor of something disarmingly uncomplicated. <br><br>This book divides the artists' work in terms of the techniques they use, from color pencils and pens to ceramics and mixed media, with some artists mixing these techniques digitally. The end results are images imbued with a great sense of fun and spontaneity.</p><p>Marc Valli is the founder of the retail and book-selling company Magma as well as the magazines <em>Graphic</em> and <em>Elephant</em>.

He developed the concept of periodization of strength in Romania in 1963, as he helped the eastern bloc countries rise to dominance in the athletic world. Since then, periodization training has become a standard method for conditioning champion athletes. Bompa has proven his system time and again, using it to train many world-class athletes including 11 Olympic medalists. </p><p>A professor emeritus at York University in Toronto, Bompa has authored several books on physical conditioning, including <i>Serious Strength Training</i>, <i>Periodization: Theory and Methodology of Training</i>, <i>Total Training for Young Champions</i>, <i>Training the Team Sports Athletes</i>, and <i>Power Training for Sport: Plyometrics for Maximum Power Development</i>, as well as numerous articles on the subject.

Commander Norton and his crew take their ship to meet it, and, once inside, discover the wonders that go to make up Rama.</p><p>An all-time science fiction classic, <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> is also one of Clarke's best novels--it won the Campbell, Hugo, Jupiter, and Nebula Awards. A huge, mysterious, cylindrical object appears in space, swooping in toward the sun. The citizens of the solar system send a ship to investigate before the enigmatic craft, called Rama, disappears. The astronauts given the task of exploring the hollow cylindrical ship are able to decipher some, but definitely not all, of the extraterrestrial vehicle's puzzles. From the ubiquitous trilateral symmetry of its structures to its cylindrical sea and machine-island, Rama's secrets are strange evidence of an advanced civilization. But who, and where, are the Ramans, and what do they want with humans? Perhaps the answer lies with the busily working biots, or the sealed-off buildings, or the inaccessible "southern" half of the enormous cylinder. Rama's unsolved mysteries are tantalizing indeed. <i>Rendezvous with Rama</i> is fast moving, fascinating, and a must-read for science fiction fans. Clarke collaborated with Gentry Lee in writing several Rama sequels, beginning with <i>Rama II</i>.At first, only a few things are known about the celestial object that astronomers dub Rama. It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object. It is, incredible, an interstellar spacecraft. Space explorers and planet-bound scientists alike prepare for mankind's first encounter with alien intelligence. It will kindle their wildest dreams... and fan their darkest fears. For no one knows who the Ramans are or why they have come. And now the moment of rendezvous awaits -- just behind a Raman airlock door.<p> "Mr. Clarke is splendid...We experience that chilling touch of the alien, the not-quite-knowable, that distinguishes SF at its most technically imaginative." -- <i>The New York Times</i></p></p><h2>Complete Beatles Recording Sessions: The Official Story of the Abbey Road Years 1962-1970</h2><p>This titles covers all the recording sessions of this iconic band!</p><p>One of the most important and successful rock 'n' roll books ever published is now available in paperback.

War with the shadowy city-state of Tesh and rioting on the streets at home are pushing the teeming metropolis to the brink. In the midst of this turmoil, a mysterious masked figure spurs strange rebellion, while treachery and violence incubate in unexpected places. In desperation, a small group of renegades escapes from the city and crosses strange and alien continents in the search for a lost hope, an undying legend. In the blood and violence of New Crobuzon&#39;s most dangerous hour, there are whispers. It is the time of the Iron Council.</p><p>China Mi�ville's novel <i>Iron Council</i> is the tumultuous story of the "Perpetual Train." Born from monopolists' greed and dispatched to tame the western lands beyond New Crobuzon, the train is itself the beginnings of an Iron Council formed in the fire of frontier revolt against the railroad's masters. From the wilderness, the legend of Iron Council becomes the spark uniting the oppressed and brings barricades to the streets of faraway New Crobuzon. The sprawling tale is told through the past-and-present eyes of three characters. The first is Cutter, a heartsick subversive who follows his lover, the messianic Judah Low, on a quest to return to the Iron Council hidden in the western wilds. The second is Judah himself, an erstwhile railroad scout who has become the iconic golem-wielding hero of Iron Council's uprising at the end of the tracks. And the third is Ori, a young revolutionary on the streets of New Crobuzon, whose anger leads him into a militant wing of the underground, plotting anarchy and mayhem. <p> Mi�ville (<i>The Scar</i>, <i>Perdido Street Station</i>) weaves his epic out of familiar and heavily political themes--imperialism, fascism, conquest, and Marxism--all seen through a darkly cast funhouse mirror wherein even language is distorted and made beautifully grotesque. Improbably evoking Jack London and Victor Hugo, <i>Iron Council</i> is a twisted frontier fable cleverly combined with a powerful parable of Marxist revolution that continues Mi�ville's macabre remaking of the fantasy genre. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>Following "Perdido Street Station and "The Scar, acclaimed author China Mieville returns with his hugely anticipated Del Rey hardcover debut. With a fresh and fantastical band of characters, he carries us back to the decadent squalor of New Crobuzon--this time, decades later. <br>It is a time of wars and revolutions, conflict and intrigue.

In <i>Saving Talk Therapy</i>, master therapist Dr. Enrico Gnaulati presents powerful case studies from his practice to remind patients and therapists alike how and why traditional talk therapy works and, using cutting-edge research findings, unpacks the problematic incentives in our health-care system and in academic psychology that explain its decline.<br><br>Beginning with a discussion of the historical development of talk therapy, Dr. Gnaulati goes on to dissect the factors that have undermined it. Psychotropic drugs, if no longer thought of as a magical cure, are still over-prescribed and shunt health-care dollars to drug corporations. Managed-care companies and mental health &#x201c;carve outs&#x201d; send health-care dollars to administrators, drive many practitioners away, and over-burden those who remain. And drawing back the curtains on CBT (cognitive behavior therapy), Dr. Gnaulati shows that while it might be effective in the research lab, its findings are of limited use for the people&#x2019;s complex, real-world emotional problems.<br><br><i>Saving Talk Therapy</i> is a passionate and deeply researched case for in-depth, personally transformative psychotherapy that incorporates the benefits of an evidence-based approach and psychotropic drugs without over-relying on them.</p><p><b>Dr. Enrico Gnaulati</b> is a clinical psychologist based in Pasadena, California, and the author of the nationally acclaimed book <i>Back to Normal: Why Ordinary Childhood Behavior Is Mistaken for ADHD, Bipolar Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder</i>.

Moving beyond critique, Gnaulati provides clinical vignettes from his own practice to illustrate what is beneficial about psychodynamic/humanistic psychotherapy. For the millions of mental health patients who are dissatisfied with the dehumanized treatments they have received, and for the thousands of young mental health professionals who know the work they are doing feels much less rewarding than they had thought it would be, this is the book to read.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Ronald B.

Drawing upon a wide range of research, he also does the public and mental health professions a great service by questioning the often extravagant claims made for the effectiveness and safety of psychiatric medication, and the overstated benefits of quick-fix therapies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Steen Halling, professor of psychology emeritus, Seattle University, and author of <i>Intimacy, Transcendence, and Psychology: Closeness and Openness in Everyday Life</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Saving Talk Therapy</i> is an impassioned defense of the emotionally evocative form of psychotherapy that many people still seek.

Amanda and her family arrive when the town is just "a stage stop, a pump house, a few log cabins." As her father pans for gold each day, Amanda becomes bored. She digs up an old skillet, picks some berries, and bakes a "hard as a rock" pie in the old wood stove. A few tries later, she gets it right and things start to change. After Pa sells slices to the miners in the gold fields. Amanda gets her brothers to pitch in and expands her pie productions. The fun really starts when she convinces various travelers to stay in town and share their skills. As other craftsmen settle in, the girl's pie business blossoms in the now-thriving town. Amanda's Pa finally gives up the gold-panning life and joins his daughter in the bakery. Now she'll have time for the new school that everyone helped build. Watercolor illustrations capture the lively and humorous spirit of the story. Facial expressions are particularly well drawn, conveying the warmth of family and community amid the chaos of the boom town. Amanda's narration lends just the right touch of humor to an authentic, though exaggerated look at the development of the West. Young readers will particularly enjoy the way the girl subtly manipulates so many adults into contributing to the town's amazing growth.?Steven Engelfried, West Linn Public Library, OR<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.0-531-33043-5 The companion to the credibility-straining Nine for California (1996), this is a deeply satisfying story starring a resourceful heroine whose real-life counterpart is mentioned in a tiny historical footnote. Amanda and her family settle in a cabin while her father trudges off each week to prospect for gold. Even with a tumble of siblings, though, Amanda is bored until she figures out a way to do what she loves best: bake a pie. When Pa comes home and says he made 25 cents a slice from her gooseberry pie, Amanda begins to bake in earnest. But that's not all she does. She convinces a peddler to set up a trading post, encourages a prospector to open a laundry, and a cowboy to set up a livery stable. The town grows, enough for Pa to go into business with his daughter and for Amanda to think about schooling as well as pie. Smith's detailed watercolors are full of charm: Amanda's red ribbons match her gingham dress, a baby sister sleeps on a ferocious- looking bearskin rug in the cabin, and expressive, cartoony characters festoon the western landscape. It's fun to watch the town grow, spread by spread, and a map and a recipe for gooseberry pie grace the endpapers. Levitin and Smith provide a grand look at the hows and whys behind a town's growth; of course it didn't happen exactly this way--but it might have.

Lorna Kelly's odyssey from middle class British school girl to glamorous, New York Sotheby's auctioneer to volunteer in the slums of Calcutta is a trek that is sobering, inspiriing and breathtakingly compelling. En route Kelly confronts alcoholism, divorce, a growing sense of spiritual disquiet and her own "dark night." What emerges from that spiritual thirst is a buoyant and compelling affirmation of our common humanity. -- Tom Stretton. <p>(This is the second and revised edition which includes new photographs and an Epilogue explaining why the book was self-published as well as a reporting on Mother Teresa's Beatificaton, October 2003.)</p></p><p>The Camel Knows the Way<br> 6 CD Audio<br> 7hrs 45minLORNA KELLY, born and raised in England, moved to America and joined the art auction firm of Sotheby&#39;s and there became the first woman art auctioneer in America.

She continues as auctioneer at fundraisers in both the US and abroad, gives lectures on a variety of spiritual topics and is currently creating additional written works.</p><h2>Ragtime</h2><p>Published in 1975, Ragtime changed our very concept of what a novel could be. An extraordinary tapestry, Ragtime captures the spirit of America in the era between the turn of the century and the First World War.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The story opens in 1906 in New Rochelle, New York, at the home <br>of an affluent American family. <br>One lazy Sunday afternoon, the famous escape artist Harry Houdini swerves his car into a telephone pole outside their house. And almost magically, the line between fantasy and historical fact, between real and imaginary characters, disap-<br>pears. Henry Ford, Emma Goldman, J. P. Morgan, Evelyn Nesbit, Sig- mund Freud, and Emiliano Zapata slip in and out of the tale, crossing paths with Doctorow's imagined family and other fictional characters, including an immigrant peddler and a ragtime musician from Harlem whose insistence on a point of justice drives him to revolutionary violence.<br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with afford-<br>able hardbound editions of impor-<br>tant works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-<br>fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring<br>as its emblem the running torch-<br>bearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-<br>gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>E. L.

In 2014 he was honored with the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Doctorow does a fairly nice job reading his justly celebrated portrait of 1906 America. He has a sandy, pleasant, lightly accented voice and a fine sense of the dramatic--though he strangely mispronounces words, as, for instance, &#34;lau-DEN-um&#34; instead of &#34;LAU-de-num.&#34; Neither has he the comic touch as a performer to match his comic touch as a writer. More importantly, this tape suffers from the same inevitable flaw of the film and musical versions. They cannot reproduce the original&#39;s principal achievement: the stunning conjuration of ragtime music. To hear that, one must read the book silently to oneself. Y.R.

Gardner&#39;s version restores the poetry of the text and the lyricism that is lost in the earlier, almost scientific renderings. The principal theme of the poem is a familiar one: man&#39;s persistent and hopeless quest for immortality. It tells of the heroic exploits of an ancient ruler of the walled city of Uruk named Gilgamesh. Included in its story is an account of the Flood that predates the Biblical version by centuries. Gilgamesh and his companion, a wild man of the woods named Enkidu, fight monsters and demonic powers in search of honor and lasting fame. When Enkidu is put to death by the vengeful goddess Ishtar, Gilgamesh travels to the underworld to find an answer to his grief and confront the question of mortality.<p>"[Gilgamesh] has never been better served than in this new translation...Maier's contribution is the meticulous scholarship that envelopes the book...John Gardner's contribution...is the translation itself: lyrical, sinewy, emotionally uncompromising and rhythmically brilliant."</p><p>-- William L.

Many farmers continued to milk cows by hand, pump water with windmills or gasoline engines, light their way with kerosene lamps and lanterns, heat with woodstoves, and plant and harvest with horses. And many had no indoor plumbing. After war&#x2019;s end in 1945, change on the farm came rapidly. Electricity replaced lamps, lanterns, and gasoline engines. New tractors replaced horses. Hay balers made loose hay a memory. Grain combines replaced threshing machines. Not only was farm work transformed from 1945 to 1955, but so was life on farms and in rural communities. Threshing, silo filling, and corn shredding bees, where farmers gathered to help each other, became memories. Card games and neighborly visits were replaced by television. Young people left the land because mechanization required less labor. Large farms crowded out family farms. "Every Farm Tells a Story" is a first-person account of a small Wisconsin farm during and after World War II. This ""living history"" is a collection of true tales inspired by entries in Jerry Apps&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s farm account books. The values recorded in the account books prompt recollections of his childhood and the traditional family farm values and ethics instilled in him by Ma and Pa. About the Author: A professor emeritus of agriculture at the University of Wisconsin Madison, author Jerry Apps has written more than 35 books, many of them on rural history and country life. Recent titles include "When Chores Were Done" and "Humor from the Country." His writing has earned awards from the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Library Association, and Barnes and Noble Booksellers, among others.</p><p>Jerry Apps was born and raised on a Wisconsin farm in the days before electricity, central heating, or indoor plumbing. He is a former county extension agent and University of Wisconsin agriculture professor.

Dad would be supportive, at least try to be, but Dr. Ryland never approved of failure. She was on her own. And she&#x2019;d be fine.<br>Perched on the couch in Alex&#x2019;s new and already file-strewn office at the <i>Boston Register,</i> surrounded by the clutter of his half-unpacked boxes, Jane was working hard at being fine.<br>She wished she could just say no. Leave town. Change her name. Forget the jurors, forget the verdict. Talk to her mom just one more time.<br>But reality included a hefty mortgage on her condo, payments on her suddenly extravagant Audi TT, looming utility bills, and evaporating severance pay. She&#x2019;d once reported heartbreakingly headlined stories about the terrors of unemployment. Now she was unemployed. Jane knew she&#x2019;d tell Alex yes.<br>&#x201c;I vouched for you with the bigs on the fifth floor.&#x201d; Alex positioned a framed Columbia J-school diploma against one beige wall, raised his wire-rimmed glasses to his forehead, then marked the wall with a pencil, turning his back to her. &#x201c;Told &#x2019;em you were nails on the street. Tough and fair. Beat me on a couple stories, that&#x2019;s for sure. The hospital thing last year, remember?&#x201d;<br><i>I sure do.</i> &#x201c;The hospital thing&#x201d; was an overnight stakeout of a politician injured in a suspicious hit and run. Alex and Jane, each refusing to leave while the other kept watch, shared the last of the murky coffee. Jane had secretly contemplated sharing a lot more than coffee. Luckily, as she later admitted to Amy, she&#x2019;d checked Alex&#x2019;s third finger, left hand. <i>Taken.</i> At least she&#x2019;d eventually gotten an exclusive interview with the victim.<br>Alex was still talking. &#x201c;But here at the paper, we respect reporters who protect their sources. We don&#x2019;t fire them. Told &#x2019;em I figured your source threw you under the bus.&#x201d;<br>He turned to her, glasses back in place and pencil now behind his ear. &#x201c;Speaking of which. About the case. Sellica Darden told you, didn&#x2019;t she? She had to be your source. Want to talk about it? Off the record?&#x201d;<br><i>Not now, not ever</i>. &#x201c;Lawyers, you know? The appeal?&#x201d; Jane smoothed her black wool skirt over her knees, carefully pulling the hem over her best black leather boots. Looking anywhere but at Alex. Why didn&#x2019;t life have an &#x201c;Undo&#x201d; button? She hadn&#x2019;t realized she was risking her career for Sellica. She tried to keep the sorrow out of her voice. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. I really can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>Alex narrowed his eyes. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing that&#x2019;ll hurt the paper, though, right? Nothing&#x2019;ll come back to bite us? All any of us has is our reputation, you know?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Jane said.<br><i>Mortgage. Heat. Health insurance. Food. Mom would have said, &#x201c;Jane Elizabeth, you should remember every closed door means another door opens.&#x201d;</i><br>&#x201c;You can trust me, Alex. I know times are tough for newspapers. I&#x2019;m grateful Jake&#x2014;Detective Brogan&#x2014;called you about me. I&#x2019;m grateful, really, for the opportunity.&#x201d;<br>The room went silent.<br>Maybe Alex was getting cold feet, no matter what Jake had told him. Maybe no one would trust her again. The jury was wrong, not her. But how can you battle perception? Jane gathered her black leather tote bag, ready to be dismissed. Maybe it was too soon. Or too late.<br>Leaving his framed diploma propped on top of a peeling radiator, Alex leaned against the side of his battered wooden desk. He smiled, running a hand across its pitted wood. &#x201c;They told me T. R. Baylor himself, founder of the <i>Register,</i> used this very desk back in the day. Brinks job, Mayor Curley, the Boston Strangler. All the Kennedys. They offered me a new desk, you know? But keeping this one seemed right.&#x201d;<br>Jane smiled back. &#x201c;Wonder what T.R. would think about your Internet edition? And maybe there&#x2019;s a new Boston Strangler now, the one they&#x2019;re calling the Bridge Killer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Times change; news doesn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Alex replied. &#x201c;People sure don&#x2019;t. The <i>Register</i>&#x2019;s covering it, but we&#x2019;re not calling anyone the Bridge Killer yet, that&#x2019;s for sure. Who knows if those killings are connected? But yeah, you can&#x2019;t understand the future if you don&#x2019;t understand the past. I&#x2019;m hoping this desk reminds me of that.&#x201d;<br>He pulled a yellow pad from a pile beside him, flipped through the top pages, then held up a hand-drawn ...</p><h2>Hardcore Twenty-Four: A Stephanie Plum Novel</h2><p><b>Janet Evanovich&#x2019;s<i> #1 New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling sensation&nbsp;Stephanie Plum&nbsp;returns in her&nbsp;twenty-forth thriller as mutilated corpses litter the streets of New Jersey...&nbsp;<br><br></b>Trouble comes in bunches for Stephanie Plum.

Lula said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I never heard of no zombie portal.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not widely publicized that they exist.&nbsp; Mostly people in my profession know about it.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s an occupational hazard.&nbsp; I only dug into a portal once before, and I was able to beat the zombies back with my shovel, but this time was a whole other deal.&nbsp; There was too many of them, so I ran for my truck and took off.&nbsp; Only thing is they tracked me down.&nbsp; They got a real good sense of smell.&nbsp; They&#x2019;re like raggedy bloodhounds.&nbsp; They come at me when I was sleeping.&nbsp; They wanted my brain.&nbsp; That&#x2019;s what they kept saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Brains, brains, brains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I&#x2019;d be a goner if it wasn&#x2019;t for Ethel.&nbsp; She don&#x2019;t like getting woke up, and I guess zombies don&#x2019;t like snakes.&nbsp; Anyways I was able to get away, and Ethel and me climbed this tree.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because zombies can&#x2019;t climb trees?&#x201d; I asked Simon.<br><br>&#x201c;You got it,&#x201d; Simon said.&nbsp;

Simon said.&nbsp; &#x201c;My cousin Snacker is in West Virginia, and my neighbors would chop her up and fry her in bacon fat.&nbsp; You gotta promise to take care of Ethel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; I said.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Me neither,&#x201d; Lula said.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s no bother,&#x201d; Simon said.&nbsp; &#x201c;You just gotta feed her once a week.&nbsp; Just come in and leave her a groundhog or something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t usually sell groundhog in the supermarket,&#x201d; Lula said.<br><br>&#x201c;I get them from the side of the road,&#x201d; Simon said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Ethel don&#x2019;t care if they&#x2019;re swelled up or anything.&nbsp; She likes fried chicken too.&nbsp; And she wouldn&#x2019;t stick her nose up at a pizza.&nbsp; And if worse comes to worse I keep a bag of rats in the freezer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You got electric?&#x201d; Lula asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Course I got electric,&#x201d; Simon said.&nbsp; &#x201c;This here&#x2019;s a civilized neighborhood.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How are you going to get Ethel out of the tree?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I got some hotdogs,&#x201d; Simon said.&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave a trail of hotdogs that goes straight to the kitchen.&nbsp; And then once she&#x2019;s inside we&#x2019;ll lock the door.&#x201d;<br><br>Ten minutes later Simon had the hotdogs all laid out.<br><br>&#x201c;She don&#x2019;t look interested,&#x201d; Lula said, staring up at Ethel.<br><br>&#x201c;It could take a while,&#x201d; Simon said.&nbsp; &#x201c;She don&#x2019;t move so fast.&nbsp; I guess we could just leave the door open for her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You could get robbed if you do that,&#x201d; Lula said.<br><br>&#x201c;I got a fifty-pound snake for a pet,&#x201d; Simon said.&nbsp; &#x201c;Nobody comes near here excepting the zombies.&#x201d;<br><br>I cuffed Simon, loaded him into my SUV, and drove him to the police station.&nbsp; I handed Simon over to the cop in charge, and Simon explained that should a zombie show up, the cop needed to shoot the zombie in the brain.&nbsp; The cop assured Simon it was a done deal.</p><h2>The Russian Five: A Story of Espionage, Defection, Bribery and Courage</h2><p><p>When the Detroit Red Wings were rebooting their franchise after more than two decades of relative futility, they knew the best place to find world-class players who could help turn things around more quickly were conscripted servants behind the Iron Curtain.<br><br> All they had to do then was make history by drafting them, then figure out how to get them out. That&#x2019;s when the Wings turned to Keith Gave, the newsman whose clandestine mission to Helsinki, Finland, was the first phase of a of a years-long series of secret meetings from posh hotel rooms to remote forests around Europe to orchestrate their unlawful departures from the Soviet Union.<br><br> One defection created an international incident and made global headlines. Another player faked cancer, thanks to the Wings&#x2019; extravagant bribes to Russian doctors, including a big American car. Another player who wasn&#x2019;t quite ready to leave yet felt like he was being kidnapped by an unscrupulous agent. Two others were outcast when they stood up publicly against the Soviet regime, winning their freedom to play in the NHL only after years of struggle.<br><br> They are the Russian Five: Sergei Fedorov, Viacheslav Fetisov, Vladimir Konstantinov, Vyacheslav Kozlov and Igor Larionov. Their individual stories read like pulse-pounding spy novels. The story that unfolded after they were brought together in Detroit by the masterful coach Scotty Bowman is unforgettable.<br><br> This story includes details never before revealed, and by the man who was there every step of the way &#x2013; from the day Detroit drafted its first two Soviets in 1989 until they raised the Stanley Cup in 1997, then took it to Moscow for a victory lap around Red Square and the Kremlin.<br><br> The Russian Five did more to bridge Russian and American relations than decades of diplomacy and d�tente between the White House and the Kremlin. This is their story.</p></p><p>Keith Gave spent six years in the United States Army as a Russian linguist working for the National Security Agency during the Cold War. Nothing could have better prepared him for a career as a sports writer covering hockey for the Detroit Free Press. His 15 years with the newspaper were the highlight of a career spanning nearly four decades in the news industry. He also served as writer/producer for the soon-to-be-released documentary film, &#x201c;The Russian Five.&#x201d; He lives in Roscommon, Michigan, where he continues to write when he&#x2019;s not sneaking off to cast a fly to the trout on his home waters of the Au Sable River.<p>Keith&nbsp;Gave, always a terrific reporter, had a front row seat to the most fascinating and colorful chapter of Red Wings history &#x2013; the Russian Five. At times, he was smack in the middle of it, as an envoy, Russian-speaker and secret-keeper. No one could write this story with the detail, depth and understanding that Gave delivers. The result is a whirlwind story that is at times fantastical, gripping, emotional and even humorous.

Fine, As new copy in deep pink cloth boards, silver title on spine with a fine dust jacket.</p><p>Yeonmi Park was born in Hyesan, North Korea in 1993 and currently lives in New York.<p></p><p></p><p>Visit http://bit.ly/1KfF28h for a larger version of this map.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Prologue</p><p>On the cold, black night of March 31, 2007, my mother and I scrambled down the steep, rocky bank of the frozen Yalu River that divides North Korea and China. There were patrols above us and below, and guard posts one hundred yards on either side of us manned by soldiers ready to shoot anyone attempting to cross the border. We had no idea what would come next, but we were desperate to get to China, where there might be a chance to survive.</p><p>I was thirteen years old and weighed only sixty pounds. Just a week earlier, I&#x2019;d been in a hospital in my hometown of Hyesan along the Chinese border, suffering from a severe intestinal infection that the doctors had mistakenly diagnosed as appendicitis. I was still in terrible pain from the incision, and was so weak I could barely walk.</p><p>The young North Korean smuggler who was guiding us across the border insisted we had to go that night. He had paid some guards to look the other way, but he couldn&#x2019;t bribe all the soldiers in the area, so we had to be extremely cautious. I followed him in the darkness, but I was so unsteady that I had to scoot down the bank on my bottom, sending small avalanches of rocks crashing ahead of me. He turned and whispered angrily for me to stop making so much noise. But it was too late. We could see the silhouette of a North Korean soldier climbing up from the riverbed. If this was one of the bribed border guards, he didn&#x2019;t seem to recognize us.</p><p>&#x201c;Go back!&#x201d; the soldier shouted. &#x201c;Get out of here!&#x201d;</p><p>Our guide scrambled down to meet him and we could hear them talking in hushed voices. Our guide returned alone.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Hurry!&#x201d;</p><p>It was early spring, and the weather was getting warmer, melting patches of the frozen river. The place where we crossed was steep and narrow, protected from the sun during the day so it was still solid enough to hold our weight&#x2014;we hoped. Our guide made a cell phone call to someone on the other side, the Chinese side, and then whispered, &#x201c;Run!&#x201d;</p><p>The guide started running, but my feet would not move and I clung to my mother. I was so scared that I was completely paralyzed. The guide ran back for us, grabbed my hands, and dragged me across the ice. When we reached solid ground, we started running and didn&#x2019;t stop until we were out of sight of the border guards.</p><p>The riverbank was dark, but the lights of Chaingbai, China, glowed just ahead of us. I turned to take a quick glance back at the place where I was born. The electric power grid was down, as usual, and all I could see was a black, lifeless horizon. I felt my heart pounding out of my chest as we arrived at a small shack on the edge of some flat, vacant fields.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t dreaming of freedom when I escaped from North Korea. I didn&#x2019;t even know what it meant to be free. All I knew was that if my family stayed behind, we would probably die&#x2014;from starvation, from disease, from the inhuman conditions of a prison labor camp. The hunger had become unbearable; I was willing to risk my life for the promise of a bowl of rice.</p><p>But there was more to our journey than our own survival. My mother and I were searching for my older sister, Eunmi, who had left for China a few days earlier and had not been heard from since. We hoped that she would be there waiting for us when we crossed the river. Instead the only person to greet us was a bald, middle-aged Chinese man, an ethnic North Korean like many of the people living in this border area. The man said something to my mother, and then led her around the side of the building. From where I waited I could hear my mother pleading, <i>&#x201c;Aniyo! Aniyo!&#x201d;</i> No! No!</p><p>I knew then that something was terribly wrong. We had come to a bad place, maybe even worse than the one we had left.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>I am most grateful for two things: that I was born in North Korea, and that I escaped from North Korea. Both of these events shaped me, and I would not trade them for an ordinary and peaceful life. But there is more to the story of how I became who I am today.</p><p>Like tens of thousands of other North Koreans, I escaped my homeland and settled in South Korea, where we are still considered citizens, as if a sealed border and nearly seventy years of conflict and tension never divided us. North and South Koreans have the same ethnic backgrounds, and we speak the same language&#x2014;except in the North there are no words for things like &#x201c;shopping malls,&#x201d; &#x201c;liberty,&#x201d; or even &#x201c;love,&#x201d; at least as the rest of the world knows it. The only true &#x201c;love&#x201d; we can express is worship for the Kims, a dynasty of dictators who have ruled North Korea for three generations. The regime blocks all outside information, all videos and movies, and jams radio signals. There is no World Wide Web and no Wikipedia. The only books are filled with propaganda telling us that we live in the greatest country in the world, even though at least half of North Koreans live in extreme poverty and many are chronically malnourished. My former country doesn&#x2019;t even call itself North Korea&#x2014;it claims to be Chosun, the true Korea, a perfect socialist paradise where 25 million people live only to serve the Supreme Leader, Kim Jong Un. Many of us who have escaped call ourselves &#x201c;defectors&#x201d; because by refusing to accept our fate and die for the Leader, we have deserted our duty. The regime calls us traitors. If I tried to return, I would be executed.</p><p>The information blockade works both ways: not only does the government attempt to keep all foreign media from reaching its people, it also prevents outsiders from learning the truth about North Korea. The regime is known as the Hermit Kingdom because it tries to make itself unknowable. Only those of us who have escaped can describe what really goes on behind the sealed borders. But until recently, our stories were seldom heard.</p><p>I arrived in South Korea in the spring of 2009, a fifteen-year-old with no money and the equivalent of two years of primary school. Five years later, I was a sophomore at a top university in Seoul, a police administration major with a growing awareness of the burning need for justice in the land where I was born.</p><p>I have told the story of my escape from North Korea many times, in many forums. I have described how human traffickers tricked my mother and me into following them to China, where my mother protected me and sacrificed herself to be raped by the broker who had targeted me. Once in China, we continued to look for my sister, without success. My father crossed the border to join us in our search, but he died of untreated cancer a few months later. In 2009, my mother and I were rescued by Christian missionaries, who led us to the Mongolian border with China. From there we walked through the frigid Gobi Desert one endless winter night, following the stars to freedom.</p><p>All this is true, but it is not the whole story.</p><p>Before now, only my mother knew what really happened in the two years that passed between the night we crossed the Yalu River into China and the day we arrived in South Korea to begin a new life. I told almost nothing of my story to the other defectors and human rights advocates I met in South Korea. I believed that, somehow, if I refused to acknowledge the unspeakable past, it would disappear. I convinced myself that a lot of it never happened; I taught myself to forget the rest.</p><p>But as I began to write this book, I realized that without the whole truth my life would have no power, no real meaning. With the help of my mother, the memories of our lives in North Korea and China came back to me like scenes from a forgotten nightmare. Some of the images reappeared with a terrible clarity; others were hazy, or scrambled like a deck of cards spilled on the floor. The process of writing has been the process of remembering, and of trying to make sense out of those memories.</p><p>Along with writing, reading has helped me order my world. As soon as I arrived in South Korea and could get my hands on translations of the world&#x2019;s great books, I began devouring them. Later I was able to read them in English. And as I began to write my own book, I came across a famous line by Joan Didion, &#x201c;We tell ourselves stories in order to live.&#x201d; Even though the writer and I come from such different cultures, I feel the truth of those words echoing inside me. I understand that sometimes the only way we can survive our own memories is to shape them into a story that makes sense out of events that seem inexplicable.</p><p>Along my journey I have seen the horrors that humans can inflict on one another, but I&#x2019;ve also witnessed acts of tenderness and kindness and sacrifice in the worst imaginable circumstances. I know that it is possible to lose part of your humanity in order to survive. But I also know that the spark of human dignity is never completely extinguished, and that given the oxygen of freedom and the power of love, it can grow again.</p><p>This is my story of the choices I made in order to live.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PART ONE</p><p>North Korea</p><p></p><p></p><p>One</p><p>Even the Birds and Mice Can Hear You Whisper</p><p>The Yalu River winds like the tail of a dragon between China and North Korea on its way to the Yellow Sea. At Hyesan it opens into a valley in the Paektu Mountains, where the city of 200,000 sprawls between rolling hills and a high plateau covered with fields, patches of trees, and graves. The river, usually shallow and tame, is frozen solid during winter, which lasts the better part of the year. This is the coldest part of North Korea, with temperatures sometimes plunging to minus-40 degrees Fahrenheit. Only the toughest survive.</p><p>To me, Hyesan was home.</p><p>Just across the river is the Chinese city of Chaingbai, which has a large population of ethnic Koreans. Families on both sides of the border have been trading with one another for generations. As a child I would often stand in the darkness and stare across the river at the lights of Chaingbai, wondering what was going on beyond my city&#x2019;s limits. It was exciting to watch the colorful fireworks explode in the velvet black sky during festivals and Chinese New Year. We never had such things on our side of the border. Sometimes, when I walked down to the river to fill my buckets with water and the damp wind was blowing just right, I could actually smell delicious food, oily noodles and dumplings cooking in the kitchens on the other side. The same wind carried the voices of the Chinese children who were playing on the opposite bank.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, you! Are you hungry over there?&#x201d; the boys shouted in Korean.</p><p>&#x201c;No! Shut up, you fat Chinese!&#x201d; I shouted back.</p><p>This wasn&#x2019;t true. In fact, I was very hungry, but there was no use in talking about it.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>I came into this world too soon.</p><p>My mother was only seven months pregnant when she went into labor, and when I was born on October 4, 1993, I weighed less than three pounds. The doctor at the hospital in Hyesan told my mother that I was so small there wasn&#x2019;t anything they could do for me. &#x201c;She might live or she might die,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; It was up to me to live.</p><p>No matter how many blankets my mother wrapped around me, she couldn&#x2019;t keep me warm. So she heated up a stone and put it in the blanket with me, and that&#x2019;s how I survived. A few days later, my parents brought me home, and waited.</p><p>My sister, Eunmi, had been born two years earlier, and this time my father, Park Jin Sik, was hoping for a son. In patriarchal North Korea, it was the male line that really mattered. However, he quickly recovered from his disappointment. Most of the time it&#x2019;s the mother who makes the strongest bond with a baby, but my father was the one who could soothe me when I was crying. It was in my father&#x2019;s arms that I felt protected and cherished. Both my mother and my father encouraged me, from the start, to be proud of who I am.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>When I was very young, we lived in a one-story house perched on a hill above the railroad tracks that curved like a rusty spine through the city.</p><p>Our house was small and drafty, and because we shared a wall with a neighbor we could always hear what was going on next door. We could also hear mice squeaking and skittering around in the ceiling at night. But it was paradise to me because we were there together as a family.</p><p>My first memories are of the dark and the cold. During the winter months, the most popular place in our house was a small fireplace that burned wood or coal or whatever we could find. We cooked on top of the fire, and there were channels running under the cement floor to carry the smoke to a wooden chimney on the other side of the house. This traditional heating system was supposed to keep the room warm, but it was no match for the icy nights. At the end of the day, my mother would spread a thick blanket out next to the fire and we would all climb under the covers&#x2014;first my mother, then me, then my sister, and my father on the end, in the coldest spot. Once the sun went down, you couldn&#x2019;t see anything at all. In our part of North Korea, it was normal to go for weeks and even months without any electricity, and candles were very expensive. So we played games in the dark. Sometimes under the covers we would tease each other.</p><p>&#x201c;Whose foot is this?&#x201d; my mother would say, poking with her toe.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s mine, it&#x2019;s mine!&#x201d; Eunmi would cry.</p><p>On winter evenings and mornings, and even in summertime, everywhere we looked we could see smoke coming from the chimneys of Hyesan. Our neighborhood was very cozy and small, and we knew everyone who lived there. If smoke was not coming out of someone&#x2019;s house, we&#x2019;d go knock on the door to check if everything was okay.</p><p>The unpaved lanes between houses were too narrow for cars, although this wasn&#x2019;t much of a problem because there were so few cars. People in our neighborhood got around on foot, or for the few who could afford one, on bicycle or motorbike. The paths would turn slippery with mud after a rain, and that was the best time for the neighborhood kids to play our favorite chasing game. But I was smaller and slower than the other children my age and always had a hard time fitting in and keeping up.</p><p>When I started school, Eunmi sometimes had to fight the older kids to defend me. She wasn&#x2019;t very big, either, but she was smart and quick. She was my protector and playmate. When it snowed, she carried me up the hills around our neighborhood, put me in her lap, and wrapped her arms around me. I held on tight as we slid back down on our bottoms, screaming and laughing. I was just happy to be part of her world.</p><p>In the summer, all the kids went down to play in the Yalu River, but I never learned how to swim. I just sat on the bank while the others paddled out into the current. Sometimes my sister or my best friend, Yong Ja, would see me by myself and bring me some pretty rocks they&#x2019;d found in the deep river. And sometimes they held me in their arms and carried me a little way into the water before bringing me back to shore.</p><p>Yong Ja and I were the same age, and we lived in the same part of town. I liked her because we were both good at using our i...</p></p><h2>The Volcano Lover : A Romance</h2><p>Based on the lives of Sir William Hamilton, his celebrated wife, Emma, and Lord Nelson, this novel is about sex and revolution, the fate of nature, art and the collector&#39;s obsession, and love.

I guess I wish a lot of other things, too. I wish someday Dad and Bandit would pull up in front in the rig ... Dad would yell out of the cab, &#34;Come on, Leigh. Hop in and I&#39;ll give you a lift to school.&#34; Leigh Botts has been author Boyd Henshaw&#39;s number one fan ever since he was in second grade. Now in sixth grade, Leigh lives with his mother and is the new kid at school. He&#39;s lonely, troubled by the absence of his father, a cross-country trucker, and angry because a mysterious thief steals from his lunchbag. Then Leigh&#39;s teacher assigns a letter-writing project. Naturally Leigh chooses to write to Mr. Henshaw, whose surprising answer changes Leigh&#39;s life.</p><p>When, in second grade, Leigh writes to an author to tell him how much he "licked" his book, he never suspects that he'll still be writing to him four years later. And he never imagines the kinds of things he'll be writing about: <blockquote> Dear Mr. Henshaw, I am sorry I was rude in my last letter... Maybe I was mad about other things, like Dad forgetting to send this month's support payment. Mom tried to phone him at the trailer park where, as Mom says, he hangs his hat. </blockquote> It's not easy being the new kid in town, with recently divorced parents, no dog anymore, and a lunch that gets stolen every day (all the "good stuff," anyway). Writing letters, first to the real Mr. Henshaw, and then in a diary to a pretend Mr. Henshaw, may be just what he needs.<p> This Newbery Medal-winning book, by the terrifically popular and prolific Beverly Cleary (<i>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</i> and <i>Runaway Ralph</i>), exhibits a subtlety and sensitivity that will be appreciated by any youngster who feels lonely and troubled during the transition into adolescence.

Since they have evolved with local conditions and are well adapted to their climate, they often require less maintenance and won&#39;t escape to invade a balanced ecosystem. The authors&#39; extensive horticultural knowledge is distilled in this comprehensive cross section of trees native to North America, from the Atlantic to the Rockies and from northern Canada to the Gulf Coast. The main section of the book is divided into tree profiles, each describing flowers and fruit, native and adaptive range, culture, and problems. The authors also list the best seasonal features---whether a tree has striking bark in winter, for example, or bright fruit in fall. In all, more than 650 species and varieties, and more than 500 cultivars, are discussed.</p><p>Many common native trees are just as beautiful as cultivated exotics.

There, for nearly eight decades, from the 1890s to the 1960s, thrived a bibliophiles&#39; paradise. They called it the New York Booksellers&#39; Row, or, more commonly, Book Row. It&#39;s an American story, the story that this richly anecdotal historical memoir amiably tells: as American as the rags-to-riches tale of the Strand, which began its life as book stall on Eighth Street and today houses 2.5 million volumes in twelve miles of space. It&#39;s a story cast with colorful characters: like the horse-betting, poker-playing go-getter and book dealer George D. Smith; the irascible Russian-born book hunter Peter Stammer, the visionary Theodore C. Schulte; Lou Cohen, founder of the still-surviving Argosy Book Store; gentleman bookseller George Rubinowitz and his legendary shrewd wife Jenny. Rising rents, street crime, urban redevelopment, television-the reasons are many for the demise of Book Row, but in this volume, based on interviews with dozens upon dozens of the book people who bought, sold, and collected there, it lives again.</p><p>Marvin Mondlin began working in the book trade in 1951 and has been the estate book buyer for the Strand since 1974. He is a member of the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America and numerous other book-related organizations. Roy Meador, a book collector and freelance writer, has been published in such national periodicals as the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Smithsonian, and Analog.<p> In the early spring of 1962, less than a year out of college, I arrived in New York to begin what turned out to be a stay of nearly two and a half years. It was a glorious time to be there. Rents were comparatively low, housing was ample, public transit was so good that it was foolish to own a car. All the great jazz clubs were still open, two major-league teams -- the Titans and the Mets -- played at the grand old Polo Grounds, and the age of franchised retailing had not yet begun: There were stores in New York, too many of them to count, that you couldn't find anywhere else. Because my day off was Monday, I could spend it at the Metropolitan Museum (no admission charge or "suggested donation") and have the place all to myself.</p><p>Or, if I cared to venture farther afield, I could take a subway to Union Square and head for Book Row: "seven concentrated blocks on Fourth Avenue, plus a few side streets stretching west to Fifth Avenue and north to Twenty-third Street." Talk about stores you couldn't find anywhere else! Talk, too, about too many to count. Precisely how many stores there were on Book Row at any one time is now exceedingly difficult to calculate, but in the early '60s -- Book Row's last great period before its precipitous decline -- there probably were three or four dozen. The best known were Schulte's, Biblo and Tannen, Dauber and Pine and the Strand, but there were innumerable others tucked into what Marvin Mondlin and Roy Meador call "cramped, weakly lighted, inadequately heated, seldom air-conditioned spaces." How many millions of books could be found on Book Row can only be guessed at -- three or four million, maybe? -- but there can be no question that it was "America's unofficial capital for secondhand books." </p><p>Book Row was the literary Alice's Restaurant: You could get anything you wanted. "Any more or less mainstream book of a general nature with broad appeal -- literature, classic, bestseller, scholarly, preachy, self-help, how-to, inspirational, technical, scientific, instructional -- was usually available eventually for those with time and patience enough to roam from store to store," but there were also "countless books from the sweet and saintly to the weird and wicked outside the mainstream's normal channel," say, "witchcraft, brotherly love, Serbo-Croatian history, palmistry, piety in Samoa, the butterfly stroke, vegetarianism, collecting thimbles, sneezing, business trends north of the border, or whatever" -- if you wanted it, sooner or later you'd find it.</p><p>Indeed, one of the greatest satisfactions Book Row offered was the joy of the chase. You'd decide you wanted such and such a title, and then spend weeks, or months, or years, searching for it. Every store you entered held out the hope that at last it would be there, and when it wasn't your disappointment was tempered by the knowledge that right next door, or maybe a couple of storefronts away, was yet another store holding out the same hope, and then another, and then another. </p><p>Haskell Gruberger, who ran the Social Science Book Store, divided customers into "hard-core buyers" and "floaters," but as Mort Sahl once asked in another context, wasn't it possible to belong to both groups at the same time? I was a "hard-core buyer" who "came in regularly" searching for specific titles, but though I never "floated down to Fourth Avenue by accident or casual curiosity," my travels through the stores often felt a lot more like floating than searching; I didn't know what I was going to find, but I figured that if I floated long enough I'd sure enough find something, and find it I almost always did: maybe for a dollar or two (a lot of money to me in those days), maybe for a quarter or a dime.</p><p>Hunting for books on Book Row could be lonely or it could be convivial. Walk into most stores and the proprietor -- in the smaller stores invariably it was the owner, not some hired hand -- might not look up from his own reading to greet you. Or to accost you: Some Book Row storeowners were notable as much for their prickliness as for their expertise. Some might tell you that you couldn't go into one room or another; then, after they'd seen you a few times and decided you were OK, they'd hand you the keys to the kingdom and let you in. Some, if you asked after a particular title, might simply grunt in dismissal, while others might scurry back to the inner depths and come back with exactly the book you wanted.</p><p>They were a peculiar breed. They might not have acted that way, but they did it for the love of it. As one habitu� put it, "the rare book business is a highly agreeable way of making very little money," as was demonstrated by the "privations, recurrent difficulties, erratic income, financial problems and galloping uncertainties" with which they had to contend, yet many hung on for years. Their stores often went under when they retired or died, but some of those stores stayed in business for decades. The authors explain why:</p><p>"The booksellers were genuine, committed, lifelong book lovers. They derived pleasure from living and working in the presence of books. They magnified that pleasure when they provided other book lovers with the special books they had anxiously and persistently sought. . . . 'I've tried to find this book for years!' when eagerly blurted by a delighted customer was the bookseller's extra dividend for being there and having the book, whether it was on the shelf gathering dust for years or came in yesterday." </p><p>The authors trace Book Row's origins to George D. Smith, a legendary bookseller who by 1890 "had an operating bookstore at 830 Broadway -- next door, in fact, to the current Strand Book Store, at 828 Broadway." Over the years he was followed by hundreds of others, most of whom followed the same pattern: "The typical Fourth Avenue bookman started in the profession very young, often as a book scout, worked as a bookstore employee, acquired some know-how, and finally found a modest amount of capital to launch a store of his own." The stores they established "were not uncommonly family affairs," usually operated by brothers but sometimes by husbands and wives. The Strand, the only survivor, is run today by Jack Bass and his daughter, Nancy.</p><p>The Strand has survived and prospered -- it is the most famous and presumably the most successful used bookstore in the country -- for any number of reasons, the essential one being that it "adjusted as necessary through changing times and kept growing." Other stores fell victim to "high rents, or aging proprietors, or too little business," while the Strand turned itself into "a secondhand book business that was routinely selling several million books and grossing over $20 million annually." That it is still there is a blessing for book lovers, but no one who knew Book Row in its glory days can pretend that it is Book Row:</p><p>"No comparable substitute has developed, no, not even in cyberspace or those overpopulated Internet burbs. Thanks to the broadband interests and proud diversity of the booksellers there, on Book Row there wasn't just a book for every need, mood or taste. Often there was a whole section of applicable books or even an entire bookstore for every taste, mood, need. The variety, independence, and heterogeneity of the dealers and their books made Book Row a haven for reading and collecting diversity where Vive la difference meant three cheers for nonconformity. In their place have come drearily homogenized chain stores, a global electronic whirlpool erratically accessible mainly to persistent onliners with superhuman patience for slogging through vast swamps of World Wide Web distractions, and a wistfully few widely scattered individual bookshop survivors." </p><p>As that quotation suggests, there are three things to be said about Mondlin and Meador: They know books and bookselling, they have vigorous opinions, and they can't write. They also can't say no: Book Row is far too long, far too crammed with names and titles long since forgotten. But the book is written with as much love as the booksellers of Book Row brought to their trade, and it certainly will bring back happy memories to anyone lucky enough to have prowled Book Row's endless shelves. </p><p> </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Taking us from the earliest periods of prehistory through the time of female goddess worship to the rise of the male-dominated warrior state, Thompson shows the passage of humankind&#39;s relationship to nature from initial awe to persistent conquest. At the end of his journey, Thompson finds an answer to his original question: myth is the history of the soul; its creation is ongoing and its power is never-ending. This is a beautiful and fascinating book now being reissued for a new generation of readers, as well as for those it inspired originally.<b>William Irwin Thompson</b> is the author of <i>At the Edge of History</i>, <i>The Time Falling Bodies Take to Light</i> and <i>Imaginary Landscapes</i>.

From his infatuation with its initial beauty to the discounting of his previously wasted life, Augustine leaves little to the imagination regarding his need to be saved from himself.<br><br>Most of Augustine's <i>Confessions</i> are spent in a nearly catastrophe tug of war. From insult and injury to passion, lost love, and the arts--this work leads through and beyond a world where God's timing is absolutely perfect. Nothing has really changed since then. Sin is still sin--and God is still God.<br><br>Moody Classics<br>Of all the factors influencing our spiritual growth and development, pivotal books play a key role. Learning from those who have walked the path and fought the fight brings wisdom and strengthens resolve.

He became bishop of Hippo in 396 and held that position until his death. Before becoming a Christian, Augustine lived a very secular life. His mother Monica prayed for him diligently and at age 32, during a trip to Milan, Augustine heard the preaching of St. Ambrose, was convicted by the Holy Spirit, and became a Christian. His numerous written works, the most important of which are his <i>Confessions</i> and <i>City of God, </i> shaped the practice of biblical exegesis and helped lay the foundation for much of medieval and modern Christian thought.<br><br><b>DR.

That's not a cheap shot against DeLorme's atlas. It has its flaws, but for years it's been a valuable resource for Idahoans. But Benchmark's atlas seems to have cured all of DeLorme's flaws and created a detailed, easy to use, comprehensive atlas for recreationists. Benchmark spend months in Idaho gathering information and driving 12,000 miles around the state to double check its accuracy. It has three obvious improvements over the DeLorme atlas: the maps on each page overlap so you don't get lost going from page to page, the maps have contour shading so you see mountains, valleys and ridges rather than having to interpret them through topographic lines, and the atlas overlaps border areas with neighboring states. There are many other improvements. --<i>Roger Phillips.

Receiving unique, unfettered access, acclaimed filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky followed Metallica over two and a half years as they faced monumental personal and professional challenges that threatened to destroy the bands just as they returned to the studio to record their first album in four years. While the documentary itself provides an insider's view of Metallica, the two and a half years of production (and more than 1,600 hours of footage) garnered far more than can be expressed in a two-hour film.<br><br>Berlinger's book about the experience reveals the stories behind the film, capturing the energy, uncertainty, and ultimate triumph of both the filming and Metallica's bid for survival. It weaves the on-screen stories together with what happened off-screen, offering intimate details of the band's struggle amidst personnel changes, addiction, and controversy. In part because Berlinger was one of the only witnesses to the intensive group-therapy sessions and numerous band meetings, his account of his experience filming the band is the most honest and deeply probing book about Metallica - or any rock band - ever written.<br><br>This is the book both Metallica and film fans have dreamed of - a stark and honest look at one of rock's most important bands through the eyes of the most provocative documentary filmmakers working today.<br></p><p>Joe Berlinger is an award winning filmmaker and journalist. His films include <i>Brother's Keeper, Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills, Revelations: Paradise Lost2</i>, and <i>Book of Shadows: Blair Witch2</i>, among many other film and television projects. This is his first book.<br><br>Greg Milner is a senior contributing writer and former columnist for <i>Spin</i>. His writings on music, film, and technology have also appeared in <i>Slate, Salon. Fhe Village Voice, Wired, </i> <i>New York</i>, and other publications. His documentary work has screened at The International Festival of Ethnographic film. This is his first book.<br>In 2001, the hugely successful hard-rock/heavy metal band Metallica got together in a converted army bunker in San Francisco to record its first collection of new songs in years. Raw from the departure of their bass player yet determined to write and record together, the rock stars began group therapy with Phil Towle, a gentle-voiced therapist (or "performance-enhancement coach"). Far from hiding this image-smashing move, however, the band allowed acclaimed documentary filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky to film, well, whatever. Even after Metallica lead singer James Hetfield slammed the therapy and left the recording studio, the creators of the brilliant documentaries <i>Brother's Keeper</i> and <i>Paradise Lost</i> were allowed to keep filming. What emerged two years later was a rock documentary, <i>Metallica: Some Kind of Monster</i>, that is arguably as defining a portrait of the values and conflicts of our times as <i>Gimme Shelter</i> is of its time. In an absorbing narrative, Berlinger (with rock journalist Milner) describes just what it took&#x2014;the myriad decisions and risks&#x2014;to turn nearly 1,600 hours of footage into a story that delivers an emotional impact that is all the greater for being true. This book should be required reading for aspiring filmmakers because it reveals the huge difference between turning the cameras on a contrived situation that purports to be "reality" and making a cinema verit� or nonfiction film. Berlinger shows that capturing truth is both art and science, and that the best efforts require that the filmmakers risk as much as their subjects. 75 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Far from a virago who had suffered for the cause of female suffrage, Lady Astor was already near the center of the ruling society that had for so long resisted the political upheavals of the early twentieth century, having married into one of the richest families in the world. She wasn't even British, but the daughter of a famous Virginian family, and fiercely proud of her expatriate ancestry. But her moral drive was strong, and she would utilize her position of privilege and influence to blow a bracing American wind into what she regarded as the stuffy corners of British politics. </p><p>This account charts Nancy Astor's incredible story, from relative penury in the American South to a world of enormous countryside estates and townhouses, and the most lavish entertainments, peopled by the great figures of the day&#x2015;Churchill, Chamberlain, FDR, Charlie Chapin, J.

He practiced as a lawyer and became involved with politics before pursuing a financial career. He has published many articles on financial and economic matters and has broadcast frequently on the radio. His previous books include <i>Prof</i>: <i>The Life and Times of Frederick Lindemann </i>and <i>Archibald Wavell: The Life and Times of an Imperial Servant.</i></p>Nancy <br> ONE <i>In Dixie</i> Nancy Astor was born into a family with no money and no certain future, in a country vanquished in war and destitute in its aftermath. Her parents were Chiswell Dabney Langhorne and Nannie Witcher Keen, and she too was christened Nannie, the name she used until, in 1904, in her early twenties, she travelled to England, when she began calling herself Nancy. Her father, known as Chillie or Dab to his parents and wife, was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, on 4 November 1843, the eldest of five children, two others having died in infancy. A heavy, stocky, rumbustious extrovert, he was good-looking, genial and jovial, but impulsive, his charm interspersed with fits of ungoverned temper. His ancestors on his father's side were Welsh, but in the seventeenth century one of them, Captain John Langhorne, had emigrated to Virginia. Langhorne proved himself a man of substance, and in time he acquired lucrative contracts, became a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, and patented a valuable tract of land. His great-grandson, William Langhorne, was to be revered by future generations of the family for his service during the American Revolution. William's son, Major John Scarisbrooke Langhorne, married his first cousin, Elizabeth, daughter of his father's elder brother, Maurice. In 1828, their son, also Maurice, rented from its owner, a judge, a fine colonial house which had been built in 1815 next to what had once been a duelling ground, and which was consequently known as Point of Honor. It overlooked the James River, on whose banks, near Lynchburg, Virginia, Maurice and his younger brother Henry, Chillie's grandfather, established a flour milling business in 1831. Chillie's father, John, Henry Langhorne's eldest son, married the daughter of Chiswell Dabney, a lawyer and the owner of a fine plantation near Lynchburg. Named Sarah Elizabeth, she was described by her grandchildren as 'one of those strong-willed Dabneys, conceited and bumptious'; even so, Chillie had an enjoyable and comfortable childhood, spending much of it on the Dabney plantation, riding, shooting and fishing, with a little workon the farm, plenty of food, and, to 'ease the scheme of living', slaves, one of whom, a 'Negro boy named Henry', was given to Chillie when he was six, a present from his grandfather. By 1860, the Langhorne family milling business was prospering and had become one of Lynchburg's largest. From the bay windows of Point of Honor, Chillie's father could gaze out at the flowing water that turned the wheels of the mills, while his younger brother, James, managed land that he had bought in nearby Patrick County; there, as the family described it, 'crops were good, the slaves hard workers, and the Langhornes prospered'. After Henry retired, management of the mills devolved upon John, who in 1859 had formed a partnership with one Charles Scott. At first the two men had considerable success. Nurturing hopes for developing the business, they formed an ambitious plan to dam the James River and provide a new and reliable water supply for the mills and factories that were springing up along its banks. On her mother's side, Nancy's family was Irish, originally from Donegal, from where some of her ancestors had sailed to America, eventually settling and prospering in Virginia. Nancy's mother, christened Nannie but always known as Nanaire, was born on 30 August 1848, the elder of two daughters of Mary Anne Witcher and her husband Elisha Ford Keen, a land- and slave-owner who was also a lawyer and a member of Virginia's state legislature. Both the Keen and Witcher families were prominent in local politics. The proceeds of the sawmills and tobacco on the Keen estate at Cottage Hill, near Danville, provided a good living and sustained Elisha Keen's position as lawyer and senator. Nanaire attended a boarding school in North Carolina - Greensborough Female Institute - and gradually became an accomplished pianist, needlewoman and painter of watercolours. She was also a good gardener, rather more than just an issuer of orders for the planting and arranging of shrubs and flowers, as was then the practice for such ladies. Living in quiet prosperity and in harmony with their surroundings, the Keens, perhaps slightly more than the Langhornes, had come to reflect the accepted image of Virginian life - gracious, affluent, slave-owning, and content in the tranquillity of the Old South. If not among the grandest Virginian families, they were not far off the top echelon of a society whose leaders, even in the mid-nineteenth century, cherished their links with an aristocratic past and still lived in almost feudal state: fox hunting, shooting and pursuing other pleasures drawn from English traditions. On their land they created and enjoyed an atmosphere of ease and cordiality: 'The colonel with his mint juleps, the white-columned verandas peopled with belles inflouncing, ruffled gowns; the slim, aristocratic young swains proposing marriage on bended knee; the mammy, the faithful black retainer.'1 And so life might reasonably have been expected to continue, into a placid if not golden future. But the times were about to alter, shaking Southern society to its roots. In the Northern states, pressure for radical change was building. The tidal wave created by the release of that pressure was to surge over the happy Southern families, the society in which they lived, and Virginia itself, engulfing them in total ruin. As Winston Churchill put it: 'They had long dwelt comfortably upon the fertile slopes of a volcano. Now began the rumblings, tremors and exhalations which portended a frightful eruption.'2 It was during the 1850s that a volatile mix of political and economic issues began to polarise the Northern and Southern states, and to lead them towards a confrontation that would be resolved only by war. The crucible of conflict was the vast, undeveloped area of the Midwest, at first particularly in the regions that became known as Kansas and Nebraska - new territories with huge economic potential. Both North and South wanted their share of what they believed would be an economic treasure house, and, not least in order to maintain their political weight in the development of the Union, were equally anxious to harness the support of the people moving west, to settle and develop new lands. The temperature rose sharply as Northern opinion coalesced in opposition to slavery - endemic in the political and economic life of much of the South. The voice of opposition grew all the more shrill with the astonishing success of the anti-slavery novel <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, published in 1852, and was refined and magnified by a lawyer from Springfield, Illinois: Abraham Lincoln. In parallel with the political gulf that the slavery issue opened up between the two sides, there developed a stand-off over the sovereign right of states to secede from the Union. In December 1860, South Carolina broke its link with the Union, its example being soon followed by six other states, leading in February 1861 to the formation of a Confederacy of Southern states. For them, the question was one of jurisprudence: that their sovereignty was inalienable, a matter for themselves and not for the Federal Union; any state freely joining a union retained the right to leave it. The leaders of the Northern states believed that a crisis was upon them: they would not countenance the right of secession, with its consequent weakening of the Union. They stiffened their resolve with moral indignation at the thought of the entrenchment of slave states, and even of an increase in their numbers. At length the verbal confrontation between North and South led tophysical violence. In April 1861, forces of the newly formed Confederacy bombarded Union troops occupying Fort Sumter, a coastal fortification at Charleston, South Carolina. It was the attack that effectively started the Civil War. In the four-year conflict that followed, the Confederate forces began with a number of military successes. The first, in July 1861, was an action by the Bull Run stream at Manassas, which was close enough to Washington for many Union politicians to ride out from the capital, accompanied by food, drink and their ladies, to observe the promised excitement of a battle. On the day, however, their expectations of an enjoyable programme turned to consternation, for, standing 'like a stone wall' on a hillside in their path, the Confederate General Jackson halted the Federal advance in its tracks, turning the blue-coated Northerners to flight. In a short time the well-dressed spectators and their carriages found themselves dragged among a tangled rout of soldiers fleeing headlong back to the outskirts of their capital. The following year the tables turned, and for the so-called rebels the bright start faded into the dark hardship of withdrawal. Thereafter, the Army of Northern Virginia fought seven great battles, but for the troops, despite the inspiring leadership of their great general, Robert E. Lee, each was a bleak station on the road to defeat. For the families of Virginia, memories of the conflict were hallowed by the initial victories of the Confederate armies and their gentlemanly leaders, especially General Lee. A glorious and gallant image of the Civil War became fixed in the soul of the South and was long to dominate its folklore. For many years, before new roots took hold and a fresh start was fostered, Virginian society drew its comfort from dreams of the antebellum age, looking back rather than ahead, living on 'peanuts and past memories'. It was easier to recall a lost world with an image built on an illusion, 'a fabled country, a feudal order of gallantry, chivalry and slaves'. 'Oh, the lazy days, the warm, still, country twilight; the high, soft Negro laughter from the quarters, the golden warmth and <i>security.</i>' 'Don't look back, Ashley, don't look back.'3 The Langhornes and the Keens, like all su...</p><h2>The House of Hapsburg: The Spanish Hapsburgs, The Hapsburgs in Central Europe (Imperial Visions Series: The Rise and Fall of Empires)</h2><p>From its earliest beginnings thousands of years ago, the course of man&#39;s progress has been measured by his empires. Large, dynamic flows of power, people, and culture that merge, thrive, then break apart - the pieces only to merge again in a new configuration, the process to be repeated. Through pictures and words, &#34;Empires: Their Rise and Fall&#34; brings the reader face to face with many of the world&#39;s greatest empires. Full-color photographs are combined with an absorbing narrative in a lively historical account of each empire and an examination of the period&#39;s most enduring cultural achievements. This volume in the series focuses on The Spanish Hapsburgs, and The Hapsburgs in Central Europe. From the 15th-Century golden age of Spanish civilization, both in Europe and the New World, to the cosmopolitan cultural life of early 20th-Century Vienna, the House of Hapsburg ruled over six centuries and three continents. One of the last great classic empires, the Central European Hapsburgs successfully balanced the conflicting interests of a dozen different nationalities while helping to spawn a renaissance in music and the arts.</p><p></p><h2>Mining Explained; a Layman&#39;s Guide</h2><p>A New Condition book with text pages being in crisp unread condition.

Alarmed by this decimation, Hornaday--a hunter, zoologist, writer, and the Smithsonian's chief taxidermist--set out for Montana to collect specimens for preservation at the Smithsonian. One of the main results of his trip was <i>The Extermination of the American Bison</i>, a timely recounting of the history and destruction of the buffalo, and a landmark work in early conservation advocacy. <br><br>Hornaday paints a vivid portrait of the buffalo's natural history, describing its distribution, habits, character, and "mental capacity," as well as the history of recorded encounters with buffalo since the sixteenth century. He then provides a haunting account of the animals' slaughter, lamenting the horrific destruction of almost the entire species. His final section describes the planning, construction, and reception of the Buffalo Group, his innovative museum display of six taxidermied buffalo that was intended to serve as both a scientific record of and a national monument to a nearly lost species. <br><br>Hanna Rose Shell's insightful introduction emphasizes how Hornaday's appeal for wildlife conservation continues to resonate today.

When Diana Vreeland became editor in chief of Vogue in 1963, she initiated a transformation, shaping the magazine into the dominant U.S. fashion publication. Vreeland&#x2019;s Vogue was as entertaining and innovative as it was serious about fashion, art, travel, beauty, and culture. Vreeland rarely held meetings and communicated with her staff and photographers through memos dictated from her office or Park Avenue apartment. This extraordinary compilation of more than 250 pieces of Vreeland&#x2019;s personal correspondence&#x2014;most published here for the first time&#x2014;includes letters to Cecil Beaton, Horst P. Horst, Norman Parkinson, Veruschka, and Cristobal Balenciaga and memos that show the direction of some of Vogue&#x2019;s most legendary stories. These display Vreeland&#x2019;s irreverence and her characteristically over-the-top pronouncements and reveal her sharpness about the Vogue woman and what the magazine should be. Photographs from the magazine illustrate the memos, showing her imagination, prescience, and exactitude. Each chapter is introduced by commentary from Vogue editors who worked with her, giving readers a truly inside look at how Diana Vreeland directed the course of the magazine and fashion world.</p><p>Alexander Vreeland is the grandson of Diana Vreeland and president of the Diana Vreeland Estate. Polly Mellen was a fashion editor at Vogue for twenty-five years. Grace Mirabella was Vogue&#x2019;s editor in chief from 1971 to 1988. Susan Train is the Paris bureau chief of Cond� Nast Publications.<p>&#x201c;Memos tells the story of this transformation through fascinating and witty personal correspondence, many containing amendments in Vreeland's own distinctive and fantastic handwriting. This really is the perfect book for any individual looking for personal and behind-the-scenes insight in to the world of fashion publishing, and where better to begin with the legend that is Diana Vreeland!&#x201d; -<i>Political Style</i><br><br> "The whip-smart mind, devil-may-care whimsy, explosive imagination and sheer fashion genius that were hers are the heart of&nbsp;<i>Memos</i>...

Griffin, whose novels about various branches of the military have won him battalions of fans, returns to the Brotherhood of War series with this crackling yarn. A detachment of Special Forces hotshots teams up with presidential counselor Sandy Felter to put a stop to Che Guevara's attempts to "liberate" the Congo from President Joseph Mobutu's anticommunist government. <p> Under Felter's direction, the Green Berets dispatch a special detachment to the Congo. Their mission is to convince Mobutu of the wisdom of the American plan to discredit and humiliate Che and his Cuban troops, rather than martyr him, and thus bring an end to his plan to export Castro-style communism to Africa and South America. Repelling the Simba insurgents with help from forces led by South African mercenary Mike Hoare, Mobutu accepts the plan, along with the Green Beret's covert assistance, war materiel, and a fighting force manned by many of the characters who peopled <i>The Aviators</i>, Griffin's last Brotherhood adventure. Yes, fans, the good guys are back--especially flying ace Jack Portet, (a pilot drafted into the army right out of Leopoldville, where he was helping his father run a regional airline), George Washington "Father" Lunsford, and Master Sergeant "Doubting" Thomas. And a lot of them are black, a talented crew of African American airmen and specialists pressed into the Special Forces not just because they're brave and able but because they can pass as Congolese soldiers and thereby keep the American presence under wraps. </p><p> As a matter of historical fact Guevara failed badly in the Congo, and after retreating to Cuba, tried the same gambit in Bolivia, where he eventually died under fire and gained the martyrdom the U.S. tried so hard to prevent. But <i>Special Ops</i> offers a close-up look at a little-known piece of military history in a gloriously testosterone-pumped epic, seasoned with a touch of sex and romance. That may seem incongruous, given Griffin's clipped, terse writing style, which is punctuated with plenty of military dispatches and a few gratuitous growls at the internecine rivalry among American intelligence agencies. It's even more incongruous when the general's daughter gets the flying ace, and her father's highly placed friends not only get Portet an officer's stripes but fly her to the Congo to stand by her man. But none of that will stop Griffin's delighted readers from snapping up his latest chronicle of men at war. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>W.E.B.

The Zygote Chronicles is her singular take on the next leg of the journey -- a riotous and poignant novel in journal form that takes us from conception to delivery room. Through the voice of a whip-smart, sass-talking everywoman Zygote reveals the unsettling and uproarious truth about pregnancy and the prospect of motherhood. The Zygote Chronicles will resonate for any woman who has even briefly considered motherhood. The strange purgatory of pregnancy has been a fact of life since Eve ate the apple, but never has it been recounted in such brilliant, hilarious detail.</p><p>"This is the time of real butter," writes Suzanne Finnamore in <i>The Zygote Chronicles</i>, her fictional journal of pregnancy. In fresh, fed-up language, Finnamore (<i>Otherwise Engaged</i>) captures the universal truths of pregnancy that can seem almost insultingly personal when they happen to you. Finnamore sings the joys of whole cream dairy products, but the blues make themselves heard as well. The narrator, an advertising executive, frets about her credibility at work. "I'm a little worried that I won't have any authority left when I get big and have Pamela Anderson breasts. I may have to compensate in some way. I may have to start carrying a hammer." Women have always been funny about pregnancy, and Finnamore gets all that black humor down on paper. It should be noted, however, that the narrator's grousing can wear a bit thin, given her station in life (she laments giving up her Miata for an SUV). Even so, <i>The Zygote Chronicles</i> should take its place alongside Anne Lamott's <i>Operating Instructions</i> as essential reading for the intelligent breeder. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>Back Jacket blurb: &#34;One of the best, kindest, most touching, most readable, and female of books - also one of the most instructive, not only on pregnancy but on all kinds of human matters.&#39;--Fay Weldon</p><h2>Encouraging Words</h2><p>Hardcover: 230 pages Publisher: Pantheon; 1st edition (March 9, 1993) Language: English ISBN-10: 067941701X ISBN-13: 978-0679417019 Product Dimensions: 8.7 x 5.7 x 0.9 inches Shipping Weight: 14.4 ounces</p><p>Encouraging Words is a collection of short talks and brief essays that Aitken Rashi has offered his students at meditation retreats during the past two decades.

A veteran fishing guide who at one time had his own local PBS show, he lives in an old house on an Indian mound in Pineland, Florida.<b>&nbsp;ONE</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Sitting in his lab, Marion D. Ford entered a numerical password, and watched a hooded man execute three hostages with a ruby-handled knife.&nbsp; Different victims, different locations and months apart, but always the same knife, never pausing to sharpen the blade.<br> How could that be?<br> The video had been edited by a pro, that's how.<br> The knife was of interest.&nbsp; He zoomed in.&nbsp; It had a curved blade like an antique sword, with a single ruby embedded in the hilt.&nbsp; On the pommel was a crowned triangle of silver, the symbol of Persian assassins from the time of the Crusades.<br> Ford opened a second link, entered a series of codes, and this time watched raw footage of the first two executions.&nbsp; This video wasn't available to networks or politicos -- possibly, not even the White House, although Ford wasn't sure about that.&nbsp; He concentrated on the man wielding the knife: he was tall with corded forearms, but not muscular, his technique honed by video games and religious fantasies. He was a Muslim convert via Chicago, no name provided.&nbsp; <br> An egomaniac, Ford thought, who played to the cameras but revealed himself in scenes that would be omitted -- one where he used a cleaver.&nbsp; Another:&nbsp; an adolescent yowl when he lofted his trophy, a severed head. Weird, the sound he made. A wild warble made with a fluttering tongue.&nbsp; Like crows trapped in a cave. &nbsp;<br> There were two cameras from different angles, video rolling throughout.<br> The third video was different. The cameras had been paused several times, although their POV remained unchanged.&nbsp; The scenes were choppy and sometimes blurry, which wasn't typical of raw footage.&nbsp; That struck Ford as odd.&nbsp; Digital cameras had autofocus.&nbsp; The hostage behaved differently, too.&nbsp; He was an aging Caucasian male, professorial-looking, who had to be dragged to the chopping block, unlike the others who had shown no fear.<br> Why?<br> Ford hadn't been supplied with his name, either.&nbsp; That would come later -- or wouldn't. &nbsp;It wasn't his job to care.&nbsp; He opened a notebook, pocket-sized, and wrote in cyphered shorthand: "Victims #1 &amp; #2 believed they were participating in a rehearsal."<br> He erased and revised: ". . . believed they were participating in <i>another</i> rehearsal," then paused to reflect before adding, "Victim #3 might not be dead."<br> &nbsp;He made more notes while he watched the footage again.<br> The link was time-sensitive.&nbsp; When the screen went blank, he rebooted his computer -- a security precaution -- before exiting the room which contained rows of lighted aquariums, a microscope, shelves of beakers and chemicals, and, on the counter, a cylindrical Plexiglas tank in which a dozen sea jellies pulsed.<br> It was a moonless night on Sanibel Island, Florida, and breezy on this first eve in December.&nbsp; A good place to stand on the deck of a house built on stilts, and piss over the railing into the water -- a glittering stream that connected him, briefly, with the bay ten feet below.<br> Back at his desk, he sent an encrypted message that read, "When?"<br> &nbsp;<br> #<br> &nbsp;<br> For the next several days, Ford began each morning with a long sunrise swim, and sprint intervals on a butt-kicking machine called a Versaclimber.&nbsp; Pull-ups usually came next, but he'd broken a hand and torn his rotator cuff on a recent trip to Cuba.&nbsp; Only a partial tear, but he couldn't do the job he'd been assigned if it got much worse.<br> Still no word on Wednesday, so he tended to Business, which included signing documents that made him half owner of a small seaplane, a Maule M-5 with a four-cylinder turbo.&nbsp; The fuselage was blue on white; leather seats and Plexiglas doors.&nbsp; The co-owner was an old friend, and to celebrate they flew to Shark River in the Everglades and caught snook.<br> There was another good low tide on Thursday. He was wading the flats with a fly rod when he finally received an encrypted reply to his question via satellite phone.<br> That night, on his bed, while his dog watched, he laid out two passports, an olive drab travel kit, a bug jacket, a hammock, $15,000 in cash, and some other things, including a knife, a laser pointer and a small pistol, a Sig Sauer P938.<br> He'd returned from Cuba with that, too.<br> There were other weapons in a safe built into the floor -- esoteric items, but better to travel light.<br> Ford was cleaning the pistol when a knock at the door shifted his reality from the covert life he had led for many years to the realties of a small marina, on a small island, where oddities (such as the odor of Hoppe's Gun Solvent) became an eager topic of gossip. So he stashed the pistol kit, and offered his friend Mack, who owned Dinkin's Bay Marina, a chair and a cold bottle of beer.<br> Mack had some gossip of his own to share: a story that, under different circumstances, might have earned Ford's full attention.<br> "Our mystery Santa struck again," Mack said. He held the bottle to the light, then took a drink. "This time he left five hundred bucks under the console of Eddie's boat. No idea who did it. "<br> "Our Eddie?" Ford was dubious. Eddie DeAntoni, from New Jersey, was called 'Fast Eddie' for a reason.<br> "I'd think it was gambling winnings, too, or somehow illegal, if it wasn't for the money Marta's little girl found on their houseboat.&nbsp; Same thing: a red candy cane sort of box filled with old bills. Stacks of hundreds; all of them stiff, like they'd been soaked in water, then bleached. Nothing written on a card, just money. It's no accident, Doc. Sort of an early Christmas present, that's what Eddie thinks."<br> Everyone at the marina, and all of his friends, called Marion D. Ford, 'Doc.'<br> The story about Marta Est�ban and her daughters was true. Ford had helped the family escape from Cuba, which was why, two days ago, he&#x2019;d been their unanimous choice to arbitrate on what ten-year-old Sabina had discovered in an anchor well and claimed as her own: $1000 in cash. A big boost for a family in a strange country, although their adoptive marina family would have looked after them anyway.<br> "He didn't make up a story just to con the IRS," Mack added. "There's a lot of eccentric rich folks on these islands.&nbsp; That's why I always tell our guys, 'Be nice even to the assholes, 'cause you never know who they'll mention in their will."<br> "Bleached bills left in the sun," Ford mused. "Or hidden underwater. Someplace shallow. I figured Sabina found a stash of old drug money."<br> &nbsp;"Bloody well possible," Mack, who was from New Zealand, said. "It couldn't have come at a better time for Fast Eddie. The fool gave away most all his lottery winnings, and his dive business has gone to hell 'cause of Hello Dolly. Another few weeks with no charters and a cracked power head, he'd be bugger all."<br> Ford touched the stem of his glasses. "Dolly who?"<br> "Are you kidding? They quoted you in a newspaper story about herlast week.&nbsp; Dolly, the shark. Some are calling her Hello Dolly, like you're in the water, look around, and there she is.&nbsp;&nbsp; What are you gonna say? It's all anybody talks about."<br> "Why people need to give animals names --" Ford shook his head, mystified. "It&#x2019;s different from some poor dog wearing a hat or scarf or sunglasses. I probably blocked the stupid name on purpose."<br> Dolly was a twenty-five-hundred-pound great white shark who&#x2019;d been named by the biologists at Ocean Search who had tagged her. Ocean Search had tagged dozens of great whites with satellite chips that could be tracked by anyone via the Internet. Three weeks ago, the shark had surfaced off Sanibel island and might still be in the area, although sightings had not been confirmed. National headlines about her presence had slowed tourism and all but put local dive operators out of business. <br> Normally, Ford would have been happy to spend a beery evening with Mack discussing the subject. The marina's day-to-day problems&nbsp; -- even when they included a great white shark -- seemed sunny and manageable when compared to the cut-throat realities of the outside world.<br> He had a lot to do, though, so dropped a hint, saying, "I'm leaving for a conference in the morning, or I'd offer you another beer."<br> "Anyplace interesting?"<br> Ford's eyes landed on the marina's black cat, curled in the corner, then moved to the cylindrical Plexiglas tank. "I'm presenting a paper on sea jellies. Near Orlando at one of those big no-name hotels that have a name. If you think about it, remind Jeth to tend to my aquariums after you lock the gate tomorrow. He's been more forgetful than usual."<br> "Jellyfish, that's what you'll talk about?"<br> "It&#x2019;s a misnomer. They're invertebrates, not fish."<br> Mack's expression asked, <i>Who could possibly care?</i><br> "World wide," Ford explained, "there've been mega-blooms of sea jellies, and no one has figured out why. They thrive in polluted water, so that might have something to do with it. I can show you the data, if you're interested."<br> Mack's eyes dulled.&nbsp; He got up. "A hotel full of scientists," he said. "I've seen those female academic types. Like talking to textbooks with tits.&nbsp; But then, no one goes into your line of work for the excitement, do they?"<br> "I'll be back in a few days," Ford said, "but don't worry if I'm not."&nbsp; He got up. "Oh, and Hannah might stop to check on things. I told her she's welcome to overnight if she wants."<br> Capt. Hannah Smith, a top fly fishing guide, was Ford's on-again, off-again lover.<br> Mack felt an obligation to remind him, "I hear she's been dating someone. Understandable, of course. That girl's a tough one to read -- but aren't they all?"<br> Ford, moving toward the door, told him, "I've got to find my dog," and went outside.<br> &nbsp;<br> #<br> &nbsp;<br> The next afternoon he landed in Mexico, near Tulum on the Yucatan, and traveled south to where a resort the size of a cruise ship was anchored to a silver beach.&nbsp; A Florida biologist wouldn't be noticed among the eager tourist throngs, even if he loaded camping gear into a boat and didn't return for several days.<br> Ford paid cash for a locally built dugout -- a cayuca -- with an outboard.&nbsp; He pushed off before sunset.<br> South of the resort was the Bay of Ascension, a small inland sea pocked with islands and blue craters called cenotes that were openings to underground rivers.&nbsp; The craters tunneled far into the earth, and exited -- if they did -- no one knew where.<br> Ford liked that.&nbsp; Along with sea jellies, he had been researching cenote formations in the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp; Next week he planned to dive a spot called the Captiva Blue Hole with a hipster friend of his, a boat bum mystic named Tomlinson, who was among the smartest men he knew. Also among the wealthiest, which is why some at the marina believed he was the mystery Santa.<br> Cenotes were a pleasant coincidence that Tomlinson would have interpreted as a karmic omen.<br> Good luck or bad?<br> Marion Ford didn't believe in either, for the same reason he had never believed in Santa Claus.<br> &nbsp;<br> #<br> &nbsp;<br> The resort was a five-star destination, a white concrete bluff encircled by bamboo-shack poverty where its employees lived &#x2014; Mexican peasants the resort depended upon to keep tourists smiling.&nbsp; A typical worker-to-guest ratio was three to one.&nbsp; A typical income-to-income ratio wasn't available, but probably obscene.<br> Ford made use of the inequity, and cash money, to create a loose safety net of goodwill.&nbsp; A very loose net, true, but worth the effort in an area where the resort was an island unto itself.&nbsp; Beyond the eastern fence was a hundred miles of jungle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Forty kilometers to the south, through littoral swamp and withering poverty was Belize, once called British Guyana.&nbsp; Lying between was this shallow bay with its islands and blue holes, where he had fashioned a remote basecamp as well as a separate spotting post only a quarter mile from the hotel and beach.<br> Ford had done some exploring.&nbsp; He knew more about the area, he suspected, than the corporate bosses who'd built the place.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the bosses by-god knew their clientele.&nbsp; The wealthy jetted in from around the world for the sun and sex and gambling, and the illusion of limitless excess which, in the minds of some, equaled freedom.&nbsp; What the guests didn't realize was, despite the fixed smiles and amenities, the resort was an isolated outpost; a fragile life support system for those who could not, would not, survive for long outside the property's gate.<br> Why would they bother?&nbsp; There was a long list of organized activities: yoga, golf, horseback riding, scuba trips to nearby atolls, billfish charters, and day trips to archaeological sites.<br> There were many such ruins.&nbsp; This was Mexico's ancient region of Quintana Roo, home of Mayan kings and gods, and temples that, amid choking vines, mocked them both, but were still worth the hundred-Euro excursion fee (with a 'traditional' lunch included.)<br> Ford was more interested in solitary activities. Hopefully, the man he'd been sent to find would not be afraid to go out alone. There was unsupervised snorkeling, kayaks and paddleboards for rent, a two-mile "nature trail" that featured caged toucans and monkeys, and a lookout pavilion over a pond where caimans -- a variety of alligator -- waited patiently to be fed.<br> The pavilion was an ideal spot.&nbsp; Better yet, catch the man alone while he was snorkeling the reef that lay midway between the beach and Ford's spotting post hidden by trees.<br> It didn't happen.<br> He had been assigned an anonymous assistant; a &#x201c;facilitator,&#x201d; housed somewhere on the resort property.&nbsp; By the third day, he or she was getting antsy, too.&nbsp; Via encrypted phone, Ford received a text in Spanish: "M�x is leaving Wednesday, not Thursday.&nbsp; What now?"<br> Max as in M�ximo, the maximum bad guy.&nbsp; It was code for the man he had been sent to find.&nbsp; Three days ago, more information had been provided about the videos, including details about the victims and their killer.&nbsp; The man with the ruby-handled knife was a failed actor named David Abdel Cashmere, who'd converted to Islam in 2010 at a Chicago mosque, and was considered "homegrown." &nbsp;&nbsp;It was an important distinction to law enforcement and terrorist organizations.&nbsp; "Homegrown" meant his conversion was so profound he would do anything, including harm his own country, to advance his cause.&nbsp; He attended training camps for&nbsp;Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani militant group, and for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- ISIS.&nbsp;&nbsp; By 2013, he had emerged as an occasional spokesman for an al-Qaeda cell in the U.K.&nbsp; ISIS came to power at about the same time.<br> In 2014, the FBI added Cashmere to the Most Wanted list, citing his involvement with a dozen bombings.&nbsp; They included Marriott Hotels in Bali and Singapore, and several Christian day care centers in the Middle East -- 346 children killed.<br> In 2015, ISIS amped up Cashmere's status by naming him "American Senior Operative and Media Advisor," but under the name of M�ximo Al-Amerikee.&nbsp; Soon afterward, the group began to release videos of far superior quality to the cell p...</p><h2>Cooking in Cast Iron: Inspired Recipes for Dutch Ovens, Frying Pans, Grill Pans, Roaster, and more</h2><p>Stylish and functional cast-iron cookware is prized for its versatility, durability, and exceptional heating capabilities.

His reckless son, Lucien, has been lured into a deadly world of drugs and wild passion. Wentworth&#x2019;s only hope, he believes, is his old friend Henry Rathbone, who volunteers to search for the prodigal son.

This thought-provoking and comprehensive survey reveals what happened to surrealism as it travelled to and fro between Europe and Latin America. For almost three decades, journeys, encounters, exchanges, collaborations and exhibitions forged multiple links. surrealism flourished and transformed itself aided by poets and artists including Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Frida Kahlo, wifredo Lam, roberto Matta, C�sar Moro and Octavio Paz. Almost a century after the first manifestos appeared, this timely volume considers the lasting legacy the movement left.

Today, it is even part of the burgeoning economies of India and China.

This groundbreaking study introduces the Russian school through the life and thought of three of its greatest thinkers, each representing a generation&#x2014;Aleksandr Bukharev (1824&#x2013;1871), Vladimir Soloviev (1853&#x2013;1901), and Father Sergii Bulgakov (1871&#x2013;1944). <p>Author Paul Valliere provides biographical sketches and historical background on these Russian-school thinkers. The primary concern of the book, however, is with the thought of each theologian. Working almost exclusively from Russian language primary sources, Valliere explores the many creative ideas devised or adapted by the Russian school, such as the humanity of God, kenotic christology, sophiology, panhumanity, free theocracy, church-and-world dogmatics, and prophetic ecumenism. Offering the first account in English of Bukharev&#x2019;s thought and the most complete analysis of Bulgakov&#x2019;s dogmatic theology, this volume is the best study of Russian theology now available.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>The American Heritage Children&#39;s Thesaurus</h2><p>With more than 4,000 entries and 36,000 synonyms, this updated edition of the award-winning <i>American Heritage Children's Thesaurus</i> encourages young writers to think analytically about word choice.

In this new twist on the Trojan War story, Patroclus and Achilles are the quintessential mismatched pair--a mortal underdog exiled in shame and a glorious demigod revered by all--but what would a novel of ancient Greece be without star-crossed love? Miller includes other good tragic bits--foreknowledge of death, ruthless choices that pit pride and reputation against the lives of innocents, the folly of men and gods--and through her beautiful writing my spine chilled in the presence of Achilles&#x2019; mother, the sea goddess Thetis, and I became a bystander in the battlefield of Troy awash with blood, exaltation, and despair. <i>The Song of Achilles</i> infuses the essence of Homer with modern storytelling in a combination that is utterly absorbing and gratifying--I can&#x2019;t wait to see what Miller tackles next. <i>--Seira Wilson</i> <br><br> <strong> Gregory Maguire Interviews Madeline Miller</strong><br> <p><strong> Gregory Maguire is the best-selling author of <em>Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister</em>, <em>Lost, </em><em>Mirror Mirror, </em> the Wicked Years, a series that includes <em>Wicked</em>, <em>Son of a Witch</em>, <em>A Lion Among Men</em>, and most recently, <em>Out of Oz</em>. </strong></p> <p><strong> Gregory Maguire:</strong> Ms. Miller, you write with the confidence of the zealously inspired, taking as your material one of the great foundation texts of world literature. In three millennia, <em>The Iliad</em> has garnered somewhat wider attention than <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, with which I have played, so I have to ask: where do you get the noive? How did you come to dare to take on such a daunting task, and for your first book?</p> <p><strong> Madeline Miller:</strong> A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, and in my case it was just dangerous enough to get me started. If I had stopped to ponder, I think I might have been too intimidated. But it helped that Patroclus is such an underdog&#x2014;giving him voice felt like standing up for him. I had been intensely frustrated by a number of articles that kept side-stepping the love between him and Achilles, which to me felt so obviously at the story&#x2019;s heart. So I wanted to set the record straight, as I saw it.</p> <p><strong> Maguire:</strong> The novel tells the story of the rise, fall and immortalization of the golden Achilles. You approach his famous story from a sideline, that of Patroclus, his bosom companion and lover. Was it hard to keep the mighty arc of legend from overwhelming shadowy Patroclus, and did you write more of him than you ended up using, just to be sure you had him firmly grounded in your mind?</p> <p><strong>Miller:</strong> Definitely yes to the second. I actually spent five years writing a first draft of the novel, took a good long look at it, then threw it out and started from scratch. Even though not a word survived, that draft was an essential first step. It helped me understand the story and characters, especially Patroclus, from the inside out.</p> <p>As for the overwhelming legends, I actually think they worked in my favor&#x2014;because Patroclus is overwhelmed by them himself. He is this ordinary person who is pulled into a terrifying world of angry deities and destiny because of his love for Achilles.</p> <p><strong>Maguire:</strong> Having glancingly heard of this legend before, I knew more or less how it would end. I had no idea how you might handle the loss of perspective and point of view when tragedy would inevitably strike. You managed to narrate an almost impossible transition from life into myth in part, I think, by your instinctual use of a combination of present and past tense, to say nothing of a masterly combining of authorial and first person observations.

And whatever ended up working, I give all the credit to my background in theater. When I first started writing, I had this idea that I should be in control of the story, forcing it forward.

In a few hours, she would reach Crofts Vale, home to the Song Weavers Guild. She grimaced at the thought. As much as she loved to sing spells, she felt unprepared for the guild's strict program of study. What if she failed? They might say she had no talent and send her home. <br><br><i>Just do it. </i>She had delayed for three years. That was when the mage mistress from Castle Suncroft had come to southern Aronsdale in search of girls with mage ability. Everyone knew why. Prince Aron, the king's heir, had to marry a mage. Less than one hundred mages lived in all the settled lands, most with minor abilities. Allegra had been excited when she thought they might consider her for Aron's bride, but it turned out she had neither the range nor strength they sought. Well, she shouldn't let it bother her. For all she knew, he was a mean-tempered grouch with bad breath. At least she had done well enough to receive an invitation from the guild. She had felt too young to go then, only sixteen, but now she was ready. She hoped. <br><br>She didn't want to arrive at the guild smelling like a horse, though. The creek burbled at her feet, gently frothing over blue-gray rocks, and the sky arched above, squirted with puffs of cloud. She stripped off her clothes, leaving only the pendant around her neck, and eased into the water. Long fronds from a bluespindle tree trailed into the water, forming a screen on the riverbank. She wasn't certain it mattered; people often bathed outside, at least where she lived, and everyone learned to respect privacy. Nor had she seen a person, farm or village during her entire ride this morning. But just in case, she chose an especially secluded spot. <br><br>Breathing deeply, Allegra inhaled the loamy smell of mud. She ducked under the sun-warmed water and shot back out, splattering drops that glistened like diamonds. She lathered up with the soapweed plants straggling on the bank and slid her hands over her sore breasts. Those folktales where women jumped onto their steeds and galloped off valiantly into the hills had to be about less endowed women; she always ached after a long ride. <br><br>Touching herself that way led to thoughts of Tanner, a boy back home. As children, they had often tussled together, learning throws. Although they had outgrown those games, lately he wanted to wrestle again. She smiled, thinking of his feigned innocence as he challenged her to a match. Up in the loft of his family's barn, they had wrestled in sunbeams slanting through cracks in the wood, laughing and tossing straw. Then he had kissed her. It had been...nice. Odd, though. She felt more sisterly than romantic toward him. Still, she appreciated that he liked her just the way she was, a slightly plump dairymaid with wild yellow curls that never stayed tamed. <br><br>The urge to sing stirred in Allegra, and with it, her mage power. But she needed a geometric shape to create a spell. She closed her hand around her pendant, a garnet disk. She had worn it for ten years, since she had learned to make spells from a mage in her village. Today she slid into the "Song of the Lamp Dove," a lilt about the rosy imp who sent innocents chasing after each other. <br><br>Playful little scamp; naughty teasing dove <br>Spirit of the lamp; trickster of f irst love <br>You cause such a fuss with your lusty heart <br>Tempting young lovers; giving them your spark <br><br>The air took on a rosy tinge and light bathed the trees. The clarity of the spell pleased her. It was only color; she could do little more. But she liked it. <br><br>Bushes rustled farther up the bank. Startled, she stood up and peered toward the foliage while her spell faded away. A rabbit ran out and dashed down the river, disappearing into another bush. <br><br><i>Time to go, </i>she thought reluctantly. She climbed out and dried off with her tunic. She felt as if her body were humming with a healthy glow. The linen of her shift caressed her skin as she pulled it on, leaving her arms and legs bare. She gathered her other clothes and headed back to Alto, her horse. The mare stood by a cluster of trees, more alert than usual, her ears pricked forward. Allegra's pack sat on a nearby rock. She ambled past a line of trees, swinging her clothes&#x2014; <br><br>Someone behind Allegra jerked her back, the motion so unexpected that her breath came out in a huff. He held her around her waist, pinning her arms to her sides. <br><br>"Hey!" Allegra shouted, annoyed. Was some boy she hadn't seen playing a trick on her? She rammed her elbow back and hit a rock-hard torso that didn't feel like a youth's thinner frame. Startled, she twisted, turning his weight against him. She managed to roll him over her hip and f lip him onto his back, which surprised her, because she had never been good at throws, which she had only learned for fun. <br><br>She had one moment to see a man in black and red clothes; then someone else yanked her backward. Frightened now, she kicked back, hitting his shin. Her blow knocked his leg out from under him, and he lost his grip on her. <br><br>Allegra ran for her horse&#x2014;and a dark blur appeared to her right. <i>Saints, how many were there? </i>She swerved to the left, but a fourth man came at her from that side. As she spun away, someone grabbed her from behind and threw her forward. They crashed to the ground, and she f lailed, trying to free herself. She ended up twisting so she landed on her back, but it didn't help, for her assailant came down on top of her. He was long and lanky, with wiry muscles under his dark clothes. <br><br>"Get off," she yelled, and brought her knee up <i>hard. </i>He groaned as he curled into a fetal position on top of her. She wrenched out from under him and tried to scramble away, but he grabbed her ankle and dragged her back along the ground. Two other people hauled her up, and one of them lashed her wrists together behind her back. Her head spun, and she gulped in air. <br><br>The man she had kneed climbed to his feet in front of them, his face dark with anger. He backhanded her across the cheek, and her head snapped to the side. As pain shot through her face, her vision blurred. Her ears rang as if someone had hit a bell. <br><br>When he raised his hand again, she cried, "No!" <br><br>"Don't do it," one of the other men said. "If you leave marks on her skin, it will lower her price." <br><br>Allegra was having trouble breathing. Details jumped out at her in jagged bursts. Her assailants had dark hair and eyes like almost everyone in the settled lands; they wore unfamiliar black clothes with red or green streaks; they had the rangy builds of the nomads in the country of Jazid, which bordered Aronsdale in the southeast. A chill went through her as she looked into their hard faces. <br><br>Someone behind Allegra shoved down on her shoulders, and she dropped to her knees. He bound her ankles together, and as pain shot through her legs, her stunned mind f inally lurched into action. <br><br>Allegra inhaled and shouted, "Someone! Help! Any&#x2014;" <br><br>Her yell cut off as one of the men shoved a cloth into her mouth. When he tied a strip of suede around her head to hold it in, a sense of panic swelled within her. <br><br>One of the men walked over to her mare and took the reins. Then he picked up Allegra's pack. He was taller than the others, with black stubble on his chin. <i>Stubble, </i>she named him. As he brought the horse to them, he peered inside her pack. <br><br>The man who had hit her&#x2014;Fist, she thought&#x2014;considered her horse. "We can get a good price for the mare." <br><br>Her protest came out as a muff led grunt. They couldn't steal her horse! She had ridden Alto for years, since she was nine. <br><br>Fist motioned at her pack. "Is it worth anything?" <br><br>Stubble handed the bag to him. "It's mostly just clothes. They're worthless." <br><br>Her desperation surged. If they took her pack, she would lose her letters of introduction to the guild and the hexacoins she had saved for this trip. <br><br>Fist dumped her tunic and leggings onto the ground and tossed out the letters as if they were trash. When he found her bag of coins, he shook it, making the silver rattle, then unfastened the strings and peered inside. <br><br>"Not bad." Looking down at Allegra, he held up the bag and grinned. "A little something for our efforts, eh?" Then he tied her money pouch to his belt. <br><br>Allegra swore at him, but the gag turned her oaths into grunts. She strained to pull her wrists free, and the ropes bit her skin. <br><br>One of the men leaned down and grasped her necklace. When he yanked, its cord snapped. He tossed the pendant to Fist. "That'll be worth a bit." <br><br><i>No! </i>She struggled futilely. Without the pendant, she couldn't make spells. Although she could do little more than make light, she felt even more vulnerable with that ability stripped away. <br><br>Fist studied the garnet. "Nice workmanship." He untied her coin bag and stuffed the pendant inside. Then he picked up her clothes and letters and crammed them back into the pack. "We'll leave this on the other side of the border, as proof we found her in Jazid, in case anyone looks for her." <br><br>"She was by herself," another of the men said, incredulous. "Any man stupid enough to let a woman who looks like this bathe alone in a river deserves to lose her." <br><br>"Of course he does," Fist said. "But the laws here don't care what we think. It's only legal if we catch her in Jazid." He looked down at Allegra. "Pity you were foolish enough to ride there by yourself. But that isn't our problem, is it?" <br><br>Allegra wanted to spit at him. As she fought harder against her bonds, the scrape of metal on leather came from behind her. Then what felt like a dagger pricked her spine. She froze, breathing hard, too scared to move. <br><br>"Calm down," Fist said. "Do as we say, and you won't be hurt." <br><br>They heaved her to her feet, and the man on her right turned her toward him. His face was wide and weathered by the sun, with lines at the corners of his mouth. His breath smelled of onions and whiskey. Grasping her around the waist, he hefted her up, over his shoulder, so her legs hung down his front and her torso against his back. Her bound wrists fell painfully downward, away from her spine, and she groaned. Someone looped a rope through the bonds and tied it around her waist to hold her arms against her body. The man holding her carried her through the trees, also bringing her horse. It all felt unreal, a nightmare that was happening to someone else. <br><br>Within moments, they reached a wagon with rigid sides and a cloth top dyed in green and black triangles. Gold tassels hung from the corners of its roof, swaying in the breeze. <br><br>Hanging over the nomad's shoulder, she could barely see as they pulled aside a f lap at the back. Inside, the wagon was f illed with crates, chests and rolled-up rugs tied with tasseled ropes. When they laid her among the carpets as if she were just another rug, she lost what little calm she had left and struggled frantically with her bonds. <br><br>"She's going to cut her skin if she keeps doing that," one of the nomads said. <br><br>Stubble took a small bottle and a cloth out of a pocket in his shirt. When he opened the bottle, the pungent odor of suffocating-salts wafted into the air. As he poured liquid onto the cloth, the smell intensified. <br><br>"No, don't!" Allegra's cry came out as a grunt. <br><br>Stubble leaned over, one hand braced behind her head, and pressed the wet cloth against her nose. She couldn't <i>breathe. </i>She gasped, and the repulsive smell of the salts saturated her. Panicked, she fought to pull away, but someone held her in place. The smell intensified until she truly was suffocating. Darkness closed in and she knew no more. <br><br>Allegra f loated in a haze. Pain burned her wrists and ankles. Eventually one of the nomads untied the strap around her head and pulled out the gag. He offered her wine from a water bag. She drank thirstily, her mouth parched from the cloth. When he laid her down, dizziness took her and she fell back into the haze. <br><br>The next time she drifted awake, they were cutting the cords off her wrists and ankles. She groaned as they massaged the circulation into her limbs. The salve they smeared into the burns stung at f irst, but then soothed the pain. When she instinctively began to f ight, though she was only half-conscious, they tied her wrists behind her back and bound her ankles again, this time with soft cloth that didn't bite into her skin. Stubble put another cloth soaked in the salts over her face until she lost consciousness. <br><br>Time passed, several days maybe. They tended her, gave her too much watered-down wine and too little water, and twice fed her a thick soup. She was dully aware of her hunger.<br><br>Allegra awoke into darkness. Groggy and disoriented, she took a moment to realize she was on her side with someone lying next to her. He had pulled up her tunic and was stroking her breasts. When she gulped in a breath, he put his hand over her mouth and pushed her onto her back, pressing down so she couldn't speak. Her wrists were still bound behind her, and pain shot through them.<br><br>He held a dagger by her face. "Quiet," he mouthed.<br><br>She froze, able to see the blade even in the dark, it was so close to her face. When the man shifted so he lay on top of her, the pain worsened in her arms and she cried out against his hand.<br><br>"Vardok?" a voice asked. Someone dragged the man off her. She could just make out who had helped&#x2014;Stubble, the one with the salts.<br><br>"Leave her alone," Stubble told him. "I meant it when I said I wouldn't let you touch her."<br><br>"Why the hell not?" Vardok said. "They'll never know."<br><br></p><h2>Rethinking Positive Thinking: Inside the New Science of Motivation</h2><p><b>&#x201c;The solution isn&#x2019;t to do away with dreaming and positive thinking. Rather, it&#x2019;s making the most of our fantasies by brushing them up against the very thing most of us are taught to ignore or diminish: the obstacles that stand in our way.&#x201d;</b><br><br>So often in our day-to-day lives we&#x2019;re inundated with advice to &#x201c;think positively.&#x201d; From pop music to political speeches to commercials, the general message is the same: look on the bright side, be optimistic in the face of adversity, and focus on your dreams. And whether we&#x2019;re trying to motivate ourselves to lose weight, snag a promotion at work, or run a marathon, we&#x2019;re told time and time again that focusing on fulfilling our wishes will make them come true.<br><br>Gabriele Oettingen draws on more than twenty years of research in the science of human motivation to reveal why the conventional wisdom falls short. The obstacles that we think prevent us from realizing our deepest wishes can actually lead to their fulfillment. Starry-eyed dreaming isn&#x2019;t all it&#x2019;s cracked up to be, and as it turns out, dreamers are not often doers.<br><br>While optimism can help us alleviate immediate suffering and persevere in challenging times, merely dreaming about the future actually makes people more frustrated and unhappy over the long term and less likely to achieve their goals. In fact, the pleasure we gain from positive fantasies allows us to fulfill our wishes virtually, sapping our energy to perform the hard work of meeting challenges and achieving goals in real life.<br><br>Based on her groundbreaking research and large-scale scientific studies, Oettingen introduces a new way to visualize the future, called <i>mental contrasting</i>. It combines focusing on our dreams with visualizing the obstacles that stand in our way. By experiencing our dreams in our minds and facing reality we can address our fears, make concrete plans, and gain energy to take action.<br><br>In<i> Rethinking Positive Thinking</i>, Oettingen applies mental contrasting to three key areas of personal change&#x2014; becoming healthier, nurturing personal and professional relationships, and performing better at work. She introduces readers to the key phases of mental contrasting using a proven four-step process called WOOP&#x2014;Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan&#x2014;and offers advice and exercises on how to best apply this method to daily life. Through mental contrasting, people in Oettingen&#x2019;s studies have become significantly more motivated to quit smoking, lose weight, get better grades, sustain fulfilling relationships, and negotiate more effectively in business situations.<br><br>Whether you are unhappy and struggling with serious problems or you just want to improve, discover, and explore new opportunities, this book will deepen your ideas about human motivation and help you boldly chart a new path ahead.</p><p><b>Gabriele Oettingen</b> is a professor of psychology at New York University and the University of Hamburg and the author of more than a hundred articles and book chapters on the effects of future thought on cognition, emotion, and behavior. She lives in New York City and in Hamburg, Germany.<p></p><p></p><p>Author&#x2019;s Note</p><p>Throughout the book, I draw from the scientific articles and book chapters my colleagues and I have published over the past twenty years. In describing our experiments, our findings, and their implications, I have cited the articles used in the writing of this book so that readers can consult the original texts if they wish. I am deeply cognizant of the rich intellectual contributions of my coauthors, my fellow travelers in the rethinking of positive thinking.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Preface</p><p>What is your dearest wish? What dreams do you have for the future? What do you want to be or do? Imagine your dream coming true. How wonderful it would be. How fulfilling.</p><p>What holds you back from realizing your wish? What is it in <i>you</i> that stops you from really going for it?</p><p><i>Rethinking Positive Thinking </i>is a book about wishes and how to fulfill them. It draws on twenty years of research in the science of motivation. And it presents a single, surprising idea: the obstacles that we think most impede us from realizing our deepest wishes can actually hasten their fulfillment.</p><p>Approached by someone who wants to achieve a specific dream, many of us offer simple advice: think positive! Don&#x2019;t dwell on the obstacles, since that will only bring you down; be optimistic, focus on what you want to achieve; imagine a happy future in which you&#x2019;re active and engaged; visualize how much snazzier you&#x2019;ll look when you&#x2019;ve lost that twenty pounds, how much happier you&#x2019;ll feel when you&#x2019;ve snagged that promotion, how much more attractive your partner will find you when you&#x2019;ve quit drinking, how much more successful you&#x2019;ll be when you&#x2019;ve started that new business. Channel positive energy and before you know it, all your wishes and goals will come true.</p><p>Yet dreamers are not often doers. My research has confirmed that merely dreaming about the future makes people <i>less</i> likely to realize their dreams and wishes (as does dwelling on the obstacles in their path). There are multiple reasons why dreaming detached from an awareness of reality doesn&#x2019;t cut it. The pleasurable act of dreaming seems to let us fulfill our wishes in our minds, sapping our energy to perform the hard work of meeting the challenges in real life.</p><p>Another way to visualize our future exists, a more complex approach that emerges out of work I&#x2019;ve done in the scientific study of human motivation. I call this method &#x201c;mental contrasting,&#x201d; and it instructs us to dream our dreams but then visualize the personal barriers or impediments that prevent us from achieving these dreams. Perhaps we fear that by bringing our dreams directly up against reality, we&#x2019;ll quash our aspirations&#x2014;that we&#x2019;ll wind up even more lethargic, unmotivated, and stuck. But that&#x2019;s not what happens. When we perform mental contrasting, we <i>gain</i> energy to take action. And when we go on to specify the actions we intend to take as obstacles arise, we energize ourselves even further.</p><p>In my studies, people who have applied mental contrasting have become significantly more motivated to quit cigarettes, lose weight, get better grades, sustain healthier relationships, negotiate more effectively in business situations&#x2014;you name it. Simply put, by adding a bit of realism to people&#x2019;s positive imaginings of the future, mental contrasting enables them to become dreamers <i>and</i> doers.</p><p><i>Rethinking Positive Thinking </i>presents scientific research suggesting that starry-eyed dreaming isn&#x2019;t all it&#x2019;s cracked up to be. The book then examines and documents the power of a deceptively simple task: juxtaposing our dreams with the obstacles that prevent their attainment. I delve into why such mental contrasting works, particularly on the level of our subconscious minds, and introduce the specific planning process that renders it even more effective. In the book&#x2019;s last two chapters, I apply the method of mental contrasting to three areas of personal change&#x2014;becoming healthier, nurturing better relationships, and performing better at school and work&#x2014;and I offer advice on how to get started with this method in your own life. In particular, I present a four-step procedure based on mental contrasting called WOOP&#x2014;Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan&#x2014;that is easy to learn, easy to apply to short- and long-term wishes, and that is scientifically shown to help you become more energized and directed.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve written <i>Rethinking Positive Thinking </i>for individuals who are stuck and don&#x2019;t know what to do about it. It&#x2019;s also for people whose lives are just fine but who might wonder if they could be better. It&#x2019;s for people who have a particular challenge in front of them that they&#x2019;ve tried and failed to handle in the past or that they just don&#x2019;t know how to approach. Ultimately, though, I&#x2019;ve written it for all of us. We all need help motivating ourselves so that we can stay on track and move ahead.</p><p>Why is this? Well, traditional societies have more mechanisms in place&#x2014;rituals, habits, rules, laws, norms&#x2014;that circumscribe individual autonomy and assign people roles and responsibilities. The same is true in repressive societies such as North Korea or the former East Germany. When we lack freedom of action, our own choices do not matter so much because external forces push and pull us to act or prevent us from doing so. The challenge people face in these societies primarily involves keeping up their morale and persevering.</p><p>Modern Western societies are different, confronting us with what some call the &#x201c;curse of freedom.&#x201d; The pull and push of tradition and external authority seems to have subsided. Many of us experience more freedom than ever, but we are now required to act on our own&#x2014;to find it <i>in us</i> to stay motivated, energized, engaged, and connected. Nobody is guiding us, day after day, to do what it takes to stay healthy, to pursue a fulfilling career, or to build a family. Nobody is standing over us giving meaning to our lives. It&#x2019;s all on our shoulders. We need to keep ourselves on track&#x2014;and we need to restore our ability to take constructive action when we get painfully stuck.</p><p>Indulging in fantasies about the future doesn&#x2019;t help. Though enjoyable in the short term, fantasies only deplete our efforts and lead us to stumble over and over again. We wind up mired in indecision, on the verge of apathy, prone to an impulsive lurching from action to action, pushed beyond our capabilities, seething with frustration, and falling into an unhappiness we don&#x2019;t understand. But by experiencing our dreams in our minds <i>and also </i>grounding ourselves in the realities we are bound to encounter, we can charge ourselves up to tackle life head-on&#x2014;to connect with what is most real and abiding in our lives.</p><p>Whether you are unhappy and struggling with serious problems, or just want to discover, explore, and optimize hidden possibilities and opportunities, this book will deepen your ideas about human motivation and help you boldly chart a path ahead. Like so many participants in my studies, you&#x2019;ll come away more motivated than ever to connect with others, engage with the world around you, and take action. All from a single, counterintuitive question: What holds you back from realizing your dreams?</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Dreaming, Not Doing</p><p>One of my friends, a man in his early forties whom I&#x2019;ll call Ben, remembers having an intense but rather corny crush on a fellow student when he attended college during the late 1980s. He had seen this woman on several occasions while dining with his friends at a cafeteria on campus. As Ben would shave in the morning or try to pay attention during lectures, his mind would drift and he would picture what it would be like to be in a relationship with this woman. He imagined that she was an artist, and that the two of them would tour architectural ruins in Rome and gaze up at the Sistine Chapel. Maybe she would want to sketch him lying on the quad on a sunny day reading a book, or, better yet, playing jazz piano, as he often did on weekends to earn extra money. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be wonderful to share peaceful moments with someone capable of understanding and sharing his own creativity? For that matter, wouldn&#x2019;t it be wonderful to have a woman to go to the movies with, or to watch a sunset with, or to hop a bus and go to a nearby city with?</p><p>Ben didn&#x2019;t tell his friends about his daydreams; he thought of them as his little secret. They were wonderfully satisfying images, but unfortunately, they stayed just that. You see, Ben couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to ask this woman out. He told himself she was a total stranger and he&#x2019;d make a fool of himself by flirting with her. Besides, he was too busy with schoolwork to date someone. He wanted to get good grades, and it wasn&#x2019;t as if he lacked friends to hang out with on the weekends.</p><p>Why didn&#x2019;t Ben have the energy and drive to step up and make his move? He was doing what so many of us regard as essential to success&#x2014;dreaming about fulfilling our wishes. What was holding him back?</p><p>The Cult of Optimism</p><p>The notion that simply imagining our deepest wishes coming true will help us attain them is everywhere these days. Best-selling books like <i>The Secret</i>1<i> </i>and <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul</i>2<i> </i>teach us that we can make good things happen just by thinking positively, and that positive thinkers are &#x201c;healthier, more active, more productive&#x2014;and held in higher regard by those around them.&#x201d;3 So many of us do think positively, as illustrated by the unvarnished, smiling optimism of contestants on <i>American Idol</i>, who speak confidently of their talents and their dream of being discovered, or their counterparts on the <i>Bachelor</i>, many of whom express absolute certainty that they will outshine all the other girls and win the big prize. These individuals gain popularity among audiences not only for having elaborate fantasies about future success, but for living in the bubble of these fantasies and assuming without a sliver of doubt that one day their daydreams will come true.</p><p>The cult of optimism goes further than that. Advertising puts forth happy, optimistic people as paragons of success. Politicians at all levels regale the citizenry by claiming the mantle of hope and touting the virtues of the &#x201c;American dream.&#x201d; Economists chart &#x201c;consumer confidence&#x201d; and survey business leaders about how optimistic their outlook is for the future; financial markets rise and fall on such data. Popular music celebrates the ability of dreaming and dreamers to save the world. We&#x2019;re also warned from a young age and at every subsequent turn to rid ourselves of harmful &#x201c;negative self-talk&#x201d; or to &#x201c;get out of the hole of negative thinking&#x201d; if we want to succeed in life.4 An inspiring message posted on the wall of a Manhattan middle school exhorts kids to &#x201c;Reach for the moon; even if you miss, you&#x2019;ll land among the stars.&#x201d;</p><p>Optimism appears to prevail even in the face of extreme adversity. In 2008, amidst a severe recession, PepsiCo began surveying American consumers as part of its Pepsi Optimism Project. In 2010, a full 94 percent of those surveyed felt that &#x201c;optimism is important in creating new ideas that can have a positive impact on the world.&#x201d; Almost three-quarters of participants reported that they &#x201c;expect the best to happen in uncertain times.&#x201d; And over 90 percent said that they &#x201c;believe that optimism can have a strong impact on moving society forward in a positive direction.&#x201d;5 By 2013, some observers were decrying the death of the American dream and American optimism, yet a survey that year sponsored by the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company found that 73 percent of Americans saw life as &#x201c;the glass half full&#x201d; and 79 percent felt that the American dream was still alive.6 Another poll by Gallup found that 69 percent of those surveyed were &#x201c;optimistic&#x201d; about their personal prospects in 2013.7</p><p>The worship of optimism is not of recent vintage, nor is it uniquely American. It&#x2019;s a theme in world literature, from Marcus Aurelius (&#x201c;Dwell on the beauty of life&#x201d;)8 to Samuel Johnson (&#x201c;that the habit of looking on the best side of everything is worth a thousand a-year&#x201d;)9 to Dr. Seuss (&#x201c;And when things start to happen, don&#x2019;t worry, don&#x2019;t stew. Just go right along, you&#x2019;ll start happening too&#x201d;).10 But Americans traditionally have seemed to relish their optimistic outlook. &#x201c;Pessimism never won any battle,&#x201d; President Dwight Eisenhower once said. Charlie Chaplin likewise came out on the side of positive thinking, stating that &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never find rainbows if you&#x2019;re looking down.&#x201d;11</p><p>Belief in the power of optimism rests on a simple idea: by looking at the future, we can hang tough and do our best in the present. And if we are going to look ahead, thinking positively seems to be the way to go. What else are we going to do&#x2014;dwell on how doomed we are to misfortune and misery? How motivating is that? A common adage circulating on the Web (and printed on T-shirts) says it all: &#x201c;Dream it. Wish it. Do it.&#x201d;</p><p>Given optimism&#x2019;s prevalence, it sometimes feels risky to express even mildly negative viewpoints inside institutions and organizations. If you&#x2019;re in the workplace and you take the position of the &#x201c;realist,&#x201d; others will often label you a &#x201c;Debby downer&#x201d; or a killjoy. Filmmakers and television producers often shrink from offering tragic themes and sad endings, fearing that they will come across as &#x201c;too dark&#x201d; and turn viewers off. For that matter, what politician wants to question the merit of an optimistic outlook or be seen as breaking from the traditional &#x201c;can-do&#x201d; attitude?</p><p>As a German citizen who came to the United States relatively late in life, I was initially struck by how much more positive thinking was valued in the United States than back in Europe. In Germany, if you asked how someone was doing, you would usually get a frank answer, such as &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t sleep well last night,&#x201d; or &#x201c;My puppy got sick and it&#x2019;s bothering me.&#x201d; In America, I noticed how people would say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine&#x201d;&#x2014;even if something was bothering them. I also noticed that people found it jarring when someone violated the unwritten rule of positivity. In 1986, when I was a postdoctoral fellow in Philadelphia, a professor told me about a faculty meeting during which she described some difficult things happening in her life. Her colleagues became highly critical of her for being so &#x201c;negative&#x201d; in a professional setting. It was implied that she needed to learn to keep her negativity to herself, so that it wouldn&#x2019;t infect other people.</p><p>A Closer Look at Optimism</p><p>As unfamiliar as this widespread optimism was to me, I felt thankful for it and did not see it as a counterproductive presence in society. I felt people were being considerate and not dumping all their problems on one another. They valued being in a good mood and keeping others in a good mood as well. I gained a more nuanced perspective, though, when I began to study optimism during the mid-1980s. Initially, I was inspired by what I had seen in East Germany during the Cold War. I researched cross-cultural differences in levels of depressive behavior and compared pessimistic outlooks between individuals living under communism in East Germany with those who lived in West Germany&#x2019;s more open, democratic society.12 As part of this research, I went into bars (or &lt;...</p></p><h2>Sophie Calle: Did You See Me?</h2><p>This comprehensive retrospective of Sophie Calle not only celebrates the breadth of her iconoclastic work but also leads to a deeper understanding of her unique artistic vision. The work of conceptual artist Sophie Calle embraces numerous media: photography, storytelling, film, and memoir, to name a few. Often controversial, Calle&#39;s projects explore issues of voyeurism, intimacy, and identity as she secretly investigates, reconstructs and documents the lives of strangers - whether she is inviting them to sleep in her bed, trailing them through a hotel, or following them through the city. Taking on multiple roles - detective, documentarian, behavioral scientist and diarist - Calle turns the interplay between life and art on its head. The book presents Calle&#39;s best-known works, including &#34;The Blind&#34;, &#34;No Sex Last Night&#34;, &#34;The Hotel&#34;, &#34;The Address Book&#34; and &#34;A Woman Vanishes&#34;, as well as lesser known and earlier projects that have largely escaped the public eye.

Four years later, seasoned by intense training and deployments in the tense confrontations of the cold war, he became the only one of that initial group to rise to become an instructor at the navy's elite Fighter Weapons School. As a Topgun instructor, Bio was responsible for teaching the navy's and Marine Corps's best fighter pilots how to be even better. He schooled them in the classroom and then went head-to-head with them in the skies. <br> <br> Then, in August 1985, Bio was assigned to combine his day-to-day flight duties with participation in a Pentagon-blessed project to film action footage for a major Hollywood movie focusing on the lives, loves, heartbreaks, and triumphs of young fighter pilots: Top Gun. <br> <br> Bio soon found himself riding in limousines to attend gala premieres, and being singled out by giggling teenagers and awed schoolboys who recognized the name "Topgun" on his T-shirts. The book ends with his reflections on his career as a skilled naval aviator and his enduring love of flight.</p><p><strong>Dave "Bio" Baranek</strong> enjoyed a successful and satisfying twenty-year career in the United States Navy, starting with assignments to F-14 Tomcat squadrons and later assignment to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Baranek retired from the Navy in 1999 and now works as a defense contractor in the Washington, D.C. area. He lives in Burke, Virginia.The author is a retired Naval flight officer, who made several cruises aboard various carriers as the radar operator in the back seat of an F-14. One of those cruises included an ejection when the ship&#x2019;s arresting gear failed to arrest the F-14 before it went overboard. Even more challenging were his two assignments to the Topgun program, the Navy&#x2019;s elite fighter-training school, first as a student, then in the coveted position of an instructor. During that second assignment, he also helped with the Navy&#x2019;s support and the flying sequences of the classic movie Top Gun. (See above for the correct spelling.) The author is a straightforward, even plain writer, but he also has an eye for detail, and gives those details in full measure about experiences for which there is an abiding, even devouring, curiosity among aviation buffs.

How could the Jews of Warsaw&#x2015;starved and persecuted, their numbers decimated by mass deportations to concentration camps, with few weapons and no aid from outside the ghetto walls&#x2015;stand up to the might of the Third Reich? To address this question, the author of The Jews of Warsaw, 1939-1943 looks beyond the ghetto uprising itself to consider the broader character of Jewish public life as it took shape during the occupation and ghettoization of what had been Europe's greatest Jewish urban center. The book describes the growth and development of the resistance movement and armed struggle against the wider historical background and the development of clandestine communal activiies in the ghetto. It makes use of extensive primary and secondary materials from Jewish, German, and Polish sources to throw light on critical events. The Jews of Warsawy, 1939-1943 is a massive scholarly undertaking, at once authentic, scrupulously objective, and deeply moving.</p></p><p>This work chronicles the struggle of Warsaw Jewry from the outbreak of World War II (September 1939) through the final and most tragic chapter in the history of the community--the armed Jewish uprising, the annihilation of the remnant Jewish community, and the destruction of the traditional Jewish sector of the city (April-May 1943).Text: English, Hebrew (translation)</p><h2>The New York Times Book of Physics and Astronomy: More Than 100 Years of Covering the Expanding Universe</h2><p>From the discovery of distant galaxies and black holes to the tiny interstices of the atom, here is the very best on physics and astronomy from the <i>New York Times</i>!

Sunlight shone on Karen's shiny-clean face, making her look like the "before" photo of a model without makeup. But lack of makeup only revealed perfect skin, high cheekbones, and eyes like dark emeralds.<br>"I never said a word about miracles," Ann replied, her voice showing her exasperation. She was as dark as Karen was fair, half a foot shorter, and voluptuous. "All I said was that you should go to the Christmas dance at the club. What's so miraculous about that?"<br>"You said that I might meet someone wonderful and get married again," Karen answered, refusing to remember the car wreck that had taken her beloved husband from her.<br>"Okay, so shoot me, I apologize." Squinting her eyes at her once-beautiful sister-in-law, Ann found it difficult to believe that she used to be eaten up with jealousy over Karen's looks. Now Karen's hair hung lank and lifeless about her shoulders, with split ends up to her ears. She hadn't a trace of makeup on and with her pale coloring, Karen looked like a teenager without it. Instead of the elegant clothes she used to wear, she now had on an old sweat suit that Ann knew had belonged to Karen's deceased husband, Ray.<br>"You used to be the most gorgeous girl at the country club," Ann said wistfully. "I remember seeing you and Ray dance at Christmas. Remember that red dress you had, slit so high your tonsils were visible? But how you and Ray looked when you danced together was worth it! Those legs of yours had every man in the room drooling. Every man in Denver was drooling! Except my Charlie, of course, <i>he</i> never looked."<br>Over her teacup, Karen gave a faint smile. "Key words in that are 'girl' and 'Ray.' Neither of which I am or have any longer."<br>"Give me a break!" Ann wailed. "You sound as though you're ninety-two years old and should be choosing your coffin. You turned thirty, that's all. I hit thirty-five this year and age hasn't stopped me." At that Ann got up, her hand at her back, and waddled over to the sink to get another cup of herbal tea. She was so hugely pregnant she could hardly reach the kettle.<br>"Point made," Karen said. "But no matter how young or old I am, that doesn't bring Ray back." When she said the name, there was reverence in her voice, as though she were speaking the name of a deity.<br>Ann gave a great sigh, for they'd had this conversation many times. "Ray was my brother and I loved him very much, but, Karen, Ray is dead. And he's been dead for two years. It's time you started living again."<br>"You don't understand about Ray and me. We were..."<br>Ann's face was full of sympathy, and reaching across the table, she clasped Karen's wrist and squeezed. "I know he was everything to you, but you have a lot to offer some man. A man who is alive."<br>"No!" Karen said sharply. "No man on earth could fill Ray's shoes, and I'd never allow anyone to try." Abruptly, she got up from the table and walked to the window. "No one understands. Ray and I were more than just married, we were partners. We were equals; we shared everything. Ray asked my opinion about everything, from the business to the color of his socks. He made me feel useful. Can you understand that? Every man I've met before or since Ray seems to want a woman to sit still and look pretty. The minute you start telling him your opinions, he asks the waiter to give him the check."<br>There was nothing that Ann could say to contradict Karen, for Ann had seen firsthand what a good marriage they'd had. But now Ann was sick with seeing her beloved sister-in-law hide herself away from the world, so she wasn't about to tell Karen that she'd never find anyone who was half the man Ray was.<br>"All right," Ann said, "I'll stop. If you are bound and determined to commit suttee for Ray, so be it." Hesitantly, she gave her sister-in-law's back a hard look. "Tell me about that job of yours." Her tone of voice told what she thought of Karen's job.<br>Turning away from the window, Karen laughed. "Ann, no one could ever doubt your opinions on anything. First you don't like that I love my husband and second you don't approve of my job."<br>"So sue me. I think you're worth more than eternal widowhood and death-by-typing."<br>Karen could never bear her sister-in-law any animosity because Ann truly did think Karen was the best there was, and it had nothing to do with their being related by marriage. "My job is fine," she said, sitting back down at the table. "Everyone is well and everything is going fine."<br>"That boring, huh?"<br>Karen laughed. "Not horribly boring, just a little bit boring."<br>"So why don't you quit?" Before Karen could answer, Ann held up her hand. "I apologize. It's none of my business if you, with all your brains, want to bury yourself in some typing pool." Ann's eyes lit up. "So anyway, tell me about your divine, gorgeous boss. How is that beautiful man?"<br>Karen smiled -- and ignored the reference to her boss. "The other women in the pool gave me a birthday party last week." At that she lifted her eyebrows in challenge, for Ann was always saying snide things about the six women Karen worked with.<br>"Oh? And what did they give you? A hand-crocheted shawl, or maybe a rocking chair and a couple of cats?"<br>"Support hose," she said, then laughed. "No, no, I'm kidding. Just the usual things. Actually, they chipped in together and got me a very nice gift."<br>"And what was that?"<br>Karen took a drink of her tea. "Aneyeglassesholder."<br>"A what?"<br>Karen's eyes twinkled. "A holder for my eyeglasses. You know, one of those string things that goes around your neck. It's a very nice one, eighteen-karat gold. With little, ah, cats on the clasp."<br>Ann didn't smile. "Karen, you have to get out of there. The combined age of those women must be three hundred years. And didn't they notice that you don't wear glasses?"<br>"Three hundred and seventy-seven." When Ann looked at her in question, Karen said, "Their ages total three hundred and seventy-seven years. I added it up one day. And they said they knew I didn't wear glasses, but that as a woman who had just turned thirty I would soon need to."<br>"For an ancient like you, support hose are just around the corner."<br>"Actually, Miss Johnson gave me a pair last Christmas. She's seventy-one and swears by them."<br>At that Ann did laugh. "Oh, Karen, this is serious. You have to get out of there."<br><i>"Mmmmm,"</i> Karen said, looking down at her cup. "My job has its uses."<br>"What are you up to?" Ann snapped.<br>Karen gave her sister-in-law a look of innocence. "I have no idea what you mean."<br>For a moment Ann leaned back against the bench and studied her sister-in-law. "At last I am beginning to understand. You are much too clever to throw away everything. So help me, Karen Lawrence, if you don't tell me everything and tell me <i>now,</i> I'll think of some dreadful way to punish you. Like maybe not allowing you to see my baby until she's three years old."<br>When Karen's face turned white, Ann knew she had her. "Tell!"<br>"It's a nice job and the people I work with are -- "<br>Suddenly, Ann's face lit up. "Don't you play the martyr to <i>me.</i> I've known you since you were eight years old, remember? You take extra work from those old biddies so you'll know everything that's going on. I'll bet you know more about what's going on in that company than Taggert does." Ann smiled at her own cleverness. "And you let your looks go so you don't intimidate anyone. If that dragon Miss Gresham saw you as you looked a couple of years ago, she'd find some reason to fire you."<br>Karen's blush was enough to tell her that she was right.<br>"Pardon my stupidity," Ann said, "but why don't you get a job that pays a little more than being a secretary?"<br>"I tried!" Karen said vehemently. "I applied at dozens of companies, but they wouldn't consider me because I don't have a university degree. Eight years of managing a hardware store means nothing to a personnel director."<br>"You only quadrupled that store's profits."<br>"Whatever. That doesn't matter. Only that piece of paper saying I sat through years of boring classes means anything."<br>"So why don't you go back to school and get that piece of paper?"<br>"I <i>am</i> going to school!" Karen took a drink of her tea to calm herself.<br>"Look, Ann, I know you mean well, but I know what I'm doing. I know I'll never find another man like Ray who I can work <i>with,</i> so maybe I can learn enough to open a shop of my own. I have the money from the sale of Ray's half of the hardware store, and I'm managing to save most of what I earn from this job. Meanwhile, I am learning everything about running a company the size of Taggert's."<br>Karen smiled. "I'm not really an idiot about my little old ladies. They think they use me to do their work, but truthfully, I'm very selective about what I agree to do. Everything in that office, from every department, goes across my desk. And since I always make myself available for all weekends and holidays, I always see what's most urgent."<br>"And what do you plan to do with all this knowledge?"<br>"Open a business somewhere. Retail. It's what I know, although without Ray there to do the selling, I don't know how I'll cope."<br>"You should get married again!" Ann said forcefully.<br>"But I don't <i>want</i> to get married!" Karen nearly shouted. "I'm just going to get pregnant!" After she'd said it, Karen looked at her friend in horror. "Please forget that I said that," she whispered. "Look, I better go. I have things -- "<br>"Move from that seat and you're dead," Ann said levelly.<br>With a great sigh, Karen collapsed back against the upholstered banquette in Ann's sunny kitchen. "Don't do this to me. Please, Ann."<br>"Do what?" she asked innocently.<br>"Pry and snoop and generally interfere in something that is none of your business."<br>"I can't imagine what you could be referring to. I've never done anything like that in my life. Now tell me everything."<br>Karen tried to change the subject. "Another gorgeous woman came out of Taggert's office in tears last week," she said, referring to her boss, a man who seemed to drive Ann mad with desire. But Karen was sure that was because she didn't know him.<br>"What do you mean, you're 'going' to get pregnant?" Ann persisted.<br>"An hour after she left, a jeweler showed up at Taggert's office with a briefcase and two armed guards. We all figure he was buying her off. Drying her tears with emeralds, so to speak."<br>"Have you done anything yet about getting pregnant?"<br>"And on Friday we heard that Taggert was engaged -- again. But not to the woman who'd left his office. This time he's engaged to a redhead." She leaned across the table to Ann. "And Saturday I typed the prenuptial agreement."<br>That got Ann's attention. "What was in it?"<br>Karen leaned back again, her face showing her distaste. "He's a bastard, Ann. He really is. I know he's very good looking and he's rich beyond imagining, but as a human, he's not worth much. I know these...these social belles of his are probably just after his money -- they certainly couldn't like <i>him</i> -- but they are human beings and, as such, they are worthy of kindness."<br>"Will you get off your pulpit and tell me what the prenupt said?"<br>"The woman, his bride, had to agree to give up all rights to anything that was purchased with his money during the marriage. As far as I could tell, she wasn't allowed to own anything. In the event of a divorce, even the clothing he bought her would remain with him."<br>"Really? And what was he planning to do with women's clothing?" Ann wiggled her eyebrows.<br>"Nothing interesting, I'm sure. He'd just find another gorgeous gold digger who fit them. Or maybe he'd sell them so he could buy a case of engagement rings, since he gives them out so often."<br>"What is it you dislike about the man so much?" Ann asked. "He gave you a job, didn't he?"<br>"Oh, yes, he has an office full of women. I swear he instructs personnel to hire them by the length of their legs. He surrounds himself with beautiful women executives."<br>"So what's your complaint?"<br>"He never allows them to <i>do</i> anything!" Karen said with passion. "Taggert makes every decision himself. As far as I know he doesn't even ask his team of beauties what they think should be done, much less allow them to actually do it." She gripped her cup handle until it nearly snapped. "McAllister Taggert could live on a desert island all by himself. He needs no other person in life."<br>"He seems to need women," Ann said softly. She'd met Karen's boss twice and she'd been thoroughly charmed by him.<br>"He's the proverbial American playboy," Karen said. "The longer the legs, and the longer the hair, the more he likes them. Beautiful and dumb, that's what he likes." She smiled maliciously. "However, so far none of them have been stupid enough to marry him when they discover that all they get out of the marriage is <i>him."</i><br>"Well..." Ann said, seeing the anger in Karen's face, "maybe we should change the subject. How are you planning to get a baby if you run from every man who looks at you? I mean, the way you dress now is calculated to keep men at a distance, isn't it?"<br>"My! but that was good tea," Karen said. "You are certainly a good cook, Ann, and I've enjoyed our visit immensely, but I need to go now." With that she rose and headed for the kitchen door.<br>"Ow!" Ann yelled. "I'm going into labor! Help me."<br>The blood seemed to drain from Karen's face as she ran to her friend. "Lean back, rest. I'll call the hospital."<br>But as Karen reached the phone, Ann said in a normal voice, "I think it's passed, but you better stay here until Charlie gets home. Just in case. You know."<br>After a moment of looking at Ann with anger, Karen admitted defeat and sat back down. "All right, what is it you want to know?"<br>"I don't know why, but I seem to be very interested in babies lately. Must be something I ate. But anyway, when you mentioned babies, it made me want to hear all of it."<br>"There is <i>nothing</i> to tell. Really nothing. I just..."<br>"Just what?" Ann urged.<br>"I just regret that Ray and I never had children. We both thought we had all the time in the world."<br>Ann didn't say anything, just gave Karen time to sort out her thoughts and talk. "Recently, I went to a fertility clinic and had a complete examination. I seem to be perfectly healthy."<br>When Karen said no more, Ann said softly, "So you've been to a clinic and now what?"<br>"I am to choose a donor from a catalog," Karen said simply.<br>Ann's sense of the absurd got the better of her. "Ah, then you get the turkey baster out and -- "<br>Karen didn't laugh as her eyes flashed angrily. "You can afford to be smug since you have a loving husband who can do the job, but what am I supposed to do? Put an ad in the paper for a donor? 'One lonely widow wants child but no husband. Apply box three-five-six.'"<br>"If you got out more and met some men you might -- " Ann stopped because she could see that Karen was getting angry. "I know, why don't you ask that gorgeous boss of yours to do the job? He beats a turkey baster any day."<br>For a moment Karen tried to stay annoyed but Ann's persistence thawed her. "Mr. Taggert, rather than a raise," Karen mimicked, "would you mind very much giving me a bit of semen? I brought a jar, and, no, I don't mind waiting."<br>Ann laughed, for this was the old Karen, the one she'd rarely seen in the last two years.<br>Karen continued to smile. "According to my charts, I'm at peak fertility on Christmas Day, so maybe I'll just wait up for Santa Claus."<br>"Beats milk and cookies," Ann said.

Yet the Romans were first and foremost conquerors, imperialists who took by force a vast empire stretching from the Euphrates in the east to the Atlantic coast in the west. Their peace meant Roman victory and was brought about by strength and dominance rather than co-existence with neighbours. The Romans were aggressive and ruthless, and during the creation of their empire millions died or were enslaved. But the Pax Romana was real, not merely the boast of emperors, and some of the regions in the Empire have never again lived for so many generations free from major wars. So what exactly was the Pax Romana and what did it mean for the people who found themselves brought under Roman rule? Acclaimed historian Adrian Goldsworthy tells the story of the creation of the Empire, revealing how and why the Romans came to control so much of the world and asking whether the favourable image of the Roman peace is a true one. He chronicles the many rebellions by the conquered, and describes why these broke out and why most failed. At the same time, he explains that hostility was only one reaction to the arrival of Rome, and from the start there was alliance, collaboration and even enthusiasm for joining the invaders, all of which increased as resistance movements faded away.</p><p><b>Why this book? </b><br> &nbsp;<br> Peace is always a rare and precious thing and this makes the &#x201c;Roman Peace&#x201d; all the more remarkable, and I wanted to understand how it came about. I wanted also to understand what the Roman Empire meant to the people who lived in it. What was it like for the other peoples in the ancient world who found themselves living next to the Roman Empire, or were incorporated into it, whether by force or choice? It is simplistic to demonize empires&#x2014;just as it once was to celebrate them uncritically&#x2014;and there is a danger of turning conquered peoples into passive and virtuous victims of imperialist aggression. The truth is more complicated, and looking at Roman power from the viewpoint of Romans and outsiders provides many relevant insights to our own world.<br><br> <b>But wasn&#x2019;t "Pax Romana" the peace imposed by the victors, whose conceit was that they were bringing civilization to barbarians?</b><br><br> The Romans fought a lot of wars, and never granted other peoples equal status. Other kingdoms and states were either allies or real or potential enemies. Peace made Rome and its allies safe. Only once they were well on their way to establishing a large and permanent empire did the Romans begin to talk of a duty to bring peace, order, and the rule of law to a wider world. This was not achieved solely or even primarily by force. People wanted to be Roman. Peace became a reality, even if imperfect.<br> <b>Praise for <i>Caesar:</i></b><br><br> "This book makes and insightfully explains the leap from Caesar the soldier and general to Caesar the statesman and nation builder.

The coverage in the <i>Times</i> was a huge boost to the career of the then-struggling folksinger, and Shelton and Dylan became friends, seeing each other frequently around the Village folk scene. When Shelton, in the 1980s, finally got around to finishing his full-length biography of Dylan, he could draw upon a wealth of insider stories from the early days. The book is naturally strongest when describing Dylan's early career, from his coffeehouse gigs as a Woody Guthrie disciple to the insanely high artistic peaks of the mid-'60s. A particularly engaging passage concerns a freeform interview Shelton conducted with Dylan as they flew high above the Midwest in early 1966; Shelton's memories of Dylan are essential reading for fans. Shelton saw much less of the notoriously private Dylan as the years passed, and the book loses momentum as he becomes less of an eyewitness and more of a distant observer, though Dylan's story is credibly told up through the mid-1980s. <i>--Robert McNamara</i><b>Robert Shelton</b> (1926-95) wrote about music for the <i>New York Times</i> until the end of the '60s.</p><h2>The Lens of Impressionism: Photography and Painting Along the Normandy Coast, 1850-1874</h2><p>&#x2015;Features more than 100 paintings, photographs, and drawings by some of the most highly regarded and admired Western artists-Courbet, Corot, Manet, Monet, and Degas among them, as well as pioneering photographers Gustave Le Gray and Henri Le Secq The Normandy Coast, with its craggy coastline and medieval fishing villages, has long captured the interest of artists. Its seascapes are featured in the work of Impressionist masters Monet,Manet, and Boudin. Its seafaring life is welldocumented in the work of such writers as Victor Hugo and Guy de Maupassant. Through a stunning selection of paintings, photographs, and drawings, The Lens of Impressionism argues that a unique convergence of forces&#x2015;social, artistic, technological, and commercial&#x2015;along the Normandy coast profoundly impacted the development of early Impressionism and made Normandy a nexus for photographers and the avant-garde painters of the later nineteenth century. As author Carole McNamara writes, Impressionist painting has always endeavored to convey motion, but new possibilities and solutions were presented by photography . . . if painters were to continue to create works that had relevance to modern audiences, then the expression of time&#x2015;of 'instantaneity'&#x2015;would become an increasingly important consideration in their own work.</p><p>Carole McNamara, is Senior Curator of Western Art, at the University of Michigan Museum of Art.

Either I saw him or I didn&#x2019;t and I&#x2019;m crazy for real this time, she thought.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s me&#x2014;�Dolly!&#x201d; Her niece was screaming in the hall. &#x201c;Let me in! Hurry!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Momentito.&#x201d; Connie fumbled with the bolt, the police lock, finally swinging the door wide. Dolly fell in past her, her face bloody. Connie clutched at Dolly, trying to see how badly she was hurt. &#x201c;Qu� pasa? Who did this?&#x201d;<br><br>Blood was oozing from Dolly&#x2019;s bruised mouth and she grasped a wad of matted paper handkerchiefs brown with old blood and spotted bright red with fresh. Her left eye was swollen shut. &#x201c;Geraldo beat me.&#x201d; Dolly let her peel off the blue winter coat trimmed with fur and press her broad hips in pink pants back into the kitchen chair. There Dolly collapsed and began to weep. Awkwardly Connie embraced her shoulders, her hands slipping on the satin of the blouse.<br><br>&#x201c;The chair&#x2019;s warm,&#x201d; Dolly said after a few minutes. &#x201c;Get me a handkerchief.&#x201d;<br><br>Connie brought toilet paper from the hall bathroom&#x2014;�she had nothing else&#x2014;�and carefully locked the outside door again. Then she put some of the good Dominican coffee she saved for special into the drip pot and set water to boil in a kettle.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold in here,&#x201d; Dolly whimpered.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make it warmer.&#x201d; She lit the oven and turned on the burners. &#x201c;Soon it&#x2019;ll be like that hothouse of yours. . . . Geraldo beat you?&#x201d;<br><br>Dolly opened her mouth wide, gaping. &#x201c;Loo . . . Loo . . .&#x201d;<br><br>As gently as she could she poked into Dolly&#x2019;s bloody mouth. Her own flesh cringed.<br><br>Dolly jerked away. &#x201c;He broke a tooth, didn&#x2019;t he? That dirty rotten pimp! Will I lose a tooth?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think you have one broken and maybe another loose. But who am I to say? I&#x2019;m no dentist. You&#x2019;re still bleeding!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s crazy, that pig! He wants to mess me up. Connie, how come you wouldn&#x2019;t let me in? I was screaming in the hall forever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t five minutes. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought I heard voices. Is somebody here?&#x201d; Dolly looked toward the other room, the bedroom.<br><br>&#x201c;Who would be here? I had the TV on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It hurts so much. Give me something to kill the pain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aspirin?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, come on. It hurts!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hija m�a, how would I have anything?&#x201d; Connie lifted her hands to show them empty, always empty.<br><br>&#x201c;Those pills they made you take, from the State.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me give you ice.&#x201d; Dolly had heard her talking with Luciente: therefore he existed. Or Dolly had heard her talking to herself. Dolly had said the chair was warm: she had been sitting in the other chair, in front of the plate from her supper of eggs and beans. She must not think about it now, with Dolly suffering. His story was unbelievable! No, don&#x2019;t think about it. She wrapped ice cubes in a kitchen towel and brought them to Dolly. &#x201c;That prescription ran out a year ago.&#x201d; Not that she had taken the tranquilizers. She had sold the pills for a little extra money, for a piece of pork or chicken once a week, soap to wash with. She found it hard to believe anybody would take that poison intentionally, but you could peddle any kind of pill in El Barrio. Still, there had been the nuisance of going down to Bellevue, since she had been living near Dolly&#x2019;s when she had been sent away and never could get her case transferred.<br><br>&#x201c;Consuelo!&#x201d; Dolly leaned her swollen cheek on Connie&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Everything hurts! I&#x2019;m scared. He punched me in the belly, hard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why do you stay with him? What good is he? With your daughter, why have such a cabr�n hanging around?&#x201d;<br><br>Dolly gave her the mocking glance that would greet any comment she might make for the rest of her life on the subject of the welfare of children; or did she imagine it? &#x201c;Consuelo, I feel so sick. I feel lousy through and through. I have to lie down. Oh, if he makes me lose this baby, I&#x2019;ll kill him!&#x201d;<br><br>As she supported her niece&#x2019;s weight into the bedroom she felt a flash of fear or perhaps of hope that Luciente would still be there. But the tiny room held only her swaybacked bed, the chair with her alarm clock on it, the dresser, the wine jug full of dried flowers, the airshaft window incompletely covered with old curtains from better days. She undressed Dolly tenderly as a baby, but her niece groaned and cursed and wept more. The satin polka dot shirt was streaked with blood and blood had soaked through her black satin brassiere with the nipples cut out. &#x201c;But it won&#x2019;t show on your nice bra,&#x201d; Connie promised as Dolly mourned her clothes, her body, her skin. Bruises had already clotted under the velvety skin of Dolly&#x2019;s belly, her soft arms, her collarbone.<br><br>&#x201c;Mira! Is there blood on my panties? See if he made me bleed there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t bleeding there, I promise. Get under the covers. Oye, Dolly, it isn&#x2019;t that easy to lose a baby! In the sixth month, if he beat you, maybe. But in the second month that baby is better protected than you are.&#x201d; She put the alarm on the floor and sat in the straight chair beside the bed to hold Dolly&#x2019;s limp hand. &#x201c;Listen, I should take you to emergency. To Met.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me go anyplace. I hurt too much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They can give you something for the pain. I&#x2019;ll get a gypsy cab to take us. It&#x2019;s only fifteen blocks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m ashamed. &#x2018;What happened to you?&#x2019; &#x2018;Oh, my pimp beat up on me.&#x2019; In the morning I&#x2019;ll go to my own dentist. You take me down to him in the morning. Otera on Canal. You call him up at nine-�thirty in the morning and tell him to take me right away. Now hold the ice against my cheek.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dolly, how do you know Geraldo won&#x2019;t come charging up here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Consuelo!&#x201d; Dolly drawled her name in a long wail of pain. &#x201c;Be nice to me! Don&#x2019;t push me around too! I hurt, I want to rest. Be sweet to me. Give me a little yerba&#x2014;�it&#x2019;s in my purse. At the bottom of the cigarette pack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dolly! You&#x2019;re crazy to run around with your face bleeding and dope in your purse! Suppose the cops pick you up?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I had a lot of time to sort my purse when I was leaving! Come on, get it for me!&#x201d;<br><br>She was fumbling through Dolly&#x2019;s big patent leather bag, clumsy prying in another woman&#x2019;s purse, when she heard heavy steps climbing. Men in a hurry. She froze. Why? Men ran up and down the steps of the tenement all night. But she knew.<br><br>Geraldo pounded the door. She kept quiet. In the bedroom Dolly moaned and began to weep again.<br><br>Geraldo hit the door harder. &#x201c;Open the door, you old bitch! Open or I&#x2019;ll break it down. Bust your head in. Come on, open this fucking door!&#x201d; He began kicking so hard the wood cracked and started to give way.<br><br>He would break it down. She yelled, &#x201c;Wait! Wait! I&#x2019;m coming!&#x201d;<br><br>Not a door opened in the hallway. Nobody came to look out. She undid the locks and hopped back, before he could slam the door to the wall and crush her behind it. He strode in, thumping the door to the wall as she had known he would, followed by a scrawny older man in a buttoned-�up gray overcoat and a hulking bato loco named Slick she had seen with Geraldo before. They all crowded into her kitchen and Geraldo slammed the door behind.<br><br>Geraldo was Dolly&#x2019;s boyfriend. He had been a vendadero and done well enough, keeping Dolly and her little girl, Nita, from her marriage. But some squeeze in the drug trade had cut him off after he had been busted, although he had not ended up serving time. Now he made Dolly work as a prostitute, selling her body to all the dirty men in the city. He had three other girls that perhaps he had been running all the time on the side. Dolly made four.<br><br>Connie hated him. It flowed like electric syrup through her veins how she hated him. Her hatred gave her a flush in the nerves like speed coming on. Geraldo was a medium-�tall grifo with fair skin, gray eyes, kinky hair&#x2014;�pelo alambre&#x2014;�that he wore in a symmetrical Afro. He was elegant. Every time her eyes grated upon him he was attired in some new costume of pimpish splendor. She dreamed of peeling off a sleekly polished antiqued lizard high-�heeled boot and pounding it down his lying throat. She dreamed of yanking off his finger the large grayish diamond he boasted matched his scheming eyes and using it to slit his throat, so his bad poisoned blood would run out.<br><br>&#x201c;T�a Consuelo,&#x201d; he crooned. &#x201c;Caca de puta. Old bitch. Get your fat and worthless ass out of my way. Move!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get out of my house! You hurt her enough. Get out!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not anything like I&#x2019;m going to hurt that bitch if she doesn&#x2019;t shape up.&#x201d; The back of his arm striking like a rattlesnake, he shoved her into the sink. Then he strolled over to lounge blocking the bedroom door. Always he was playing in some cold deathshead mirror, watching himself, polishing his cool. &#x201c;Hey, cunt, stop blubbering. I brought you a doctor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What kind of doctor?&#x201d; Connie shrieked. She had slid under his blow and caught only the edge of the sink. She cowered, half crouching. &#x201c;A butcher! That&#x2019;s what kind of doctor!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That bughouse taught you all about doctors, um?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You leave her alone, Geraldo! She wants to have your baby so bad, she can stay with me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you can cut it up, you nut? Now turn it off or Slick will bust your lip.&#x201d; Geraldo leaned on the doorframe, lighting a cigarette and dropping the lit match on the floor, where it slowly burned out, making a black hole in the worn linoleum. &#x201c;Time to rise and fly. I brought a doctor to fix you. Up now. Move!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No! I don&#x2019;t want him to touch me! Geraldo honey, I want this baby!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What shits you pushing? You think I sweat bricks for the kid of some stupid trick with dragging balls? You don&#x2019;t even know what color worm you got turning in the apple.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your baby! It is. In Puerto Rico I didn&#x2019;t take my pills.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Woman, so many men been into you, it could have a whole subway car of daddies.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In San Juan I never took my pills. I told you already!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You tell me? Not in this life, baby. How you pass the time while I was busy in La Perla, um?&#x201d; He flicked lint from his vest.<br><br>&#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t take me to meet your family!&#x201d;<br><br>Geraldo had taken Dolly with him on vacation. Connie felt pretty sure Dolly had tried to get pregnant, believing that Geraldo would let her quit whoring. Dolly wanted to have another baby and stay home. Like figures of paper, like a manger scene of pasteboard figures, a fantasy had shone in Connie since her conversation with Dolly that morning: she and Dolly and Dolly&#x2019;s children would live together. She would have a family again, finally.<br><br>She would be ever so careful and good and she would do anything, anything at all to keep them together. She would never be jealous of her niece no matter how many boyfriends she had. Dolly could stay out all night and go off on weekends and to Florida even and she would stay with Nita and the baby. As if anyone would ever again leave her alone with a child. The dream was like those paper dolls, the only dolls she had had as a child, dolls with blond paper hair and Anglo features and big paper smiles. That she knew in her heart of ashes the dream was futile did not make it less precious. Every soul needs a little sweetness. She thought of the stalks of sugar cane the kids bought at the fruit and vegetable man. Sweet in the mouth as you chewed it, and then you spat out the husks and they lay in the street. Hollow, flimsy, for a moment sweet in the mouth. Cane with which her grandmother had sweetened the chocolate long ago in El Paso.<br><br>&#x201c;Shut off that fucking kettle!&#x201d; Geraldo shouted at her and she jumped to put out the flame. The coffee she had never finished making. The kettle had boiled almost dry. She shut off the oven and the burners because now her two small rooms felt stifling hot. How she had jumped to the stove when he rapped out that curt command. She resented obeying him automatically, instinctively jerking at the loud masculine order.<br><br>His beauty only made him more hateful. His face with the big gray eyes, the broad nose, the full cruel mouth, the hands like long talons, the proud bearing&#x2014;�he was the man who had pimped her favorite niece, her baby, the pimp who had beaten Dolly and sold her to pigs to empty themselves in. Who robbed Dolly and slapped her daughter Nita and took away the money squeezed out of the pollution of Dolly&#x2019;s flesh to buy lizard boots and cocaine and other women. Geraldo was her father, who had beaten her every week of her childhood. Her second husband, who had sent her into emergency with blood running down her legs. He was El Muro, who had raped her and then beaten her because she would not lie and say she had enjoyed it. She had had the strength then to run, to cut her losses and run. On the evening bus the next day she had left her home in Chicago, her father and sisters, the graves of her mother and her first (her real) husband, Mart�n. Dolly lacked the coarse strength that had saved her that time.<br><br>But Dolly had Nita already and a baby in the oven. &#x201c;F�jate, Geraldo,&#x201d; she screamed. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s carrying your child. She came back that way from San Juan. I told her she was carrying the first time I saw her back here. What kind of tailless wonder are you to have your own child butchered by that doctor of dogs?&#x201d;<br><br>Pivoting, Geraldo cuffed her back into the stove. The hot metal seared her back in a broad line and she clamped her lips tight, unable to scream, unable to issue a sound from the suddenness of the pain. She sank to the floor and could not speak or move.<br><br>&#x201c;Puta, get up and go with Dr. Medias, or I&#x2019;ll have him do it on you right in that witch&#x2019;s bed. Move!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No! No!&#x201d; Dolly was thrashing around in bed, screaming and sobbing. Geraldo stepped into the bedroom, out of Connie&#x2019;s line of sight. She tried to roll to her feet. The scrawny doctor sat on the edge of a kitchen chair. He was in his fifties. His clothes were new and conservative, his manner was tense, and his foot tapped, tapped. Slick was leaning against the outer door smoking a joint and grinning.</p><h2>How the Whale Became: And Other Stories</h2><p>First published in England in 1963, a collection of animal stories depicts a world of long ago in which all animals looked alike and considers how some, including the huge sea-dwelling whale, came to resemble their modern-day descendants.</p><p>Ted Hughes was born on 17 August 1930 in Mytholmroyd, a small mill town in West Yorkshire. His father made portable wooden buildings. The family moved to Mexborough, a coal-mining town in South Yorkshire, when Hughes was seven. His parents took over a newsagent and tobacconist shop, and eventually he went to the local grammar school.In 1948 Hughes won an Open Exhibition to Pembroke College, Cambridge. Before going there, he served two years National Service in the Royal Air Force. Between leaving Cambridge and becoming a teacher, he worked at various jobs, finally as a script-reader for Rank at their Pinewood Studios.In 1956 Hughes married the American poet Sylvia Plath, who died in 1963, and they had two children. He remarried in 1970. He was awarded the OBE in 1977, created Poet Laureate in December 1984 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1998. He died in October 1998.Ted Hughes&#39;s first book, The Hawk in the Rain, was published by FabeAges 4-8. First published in 1964, Hughes' creation fables await discovery by a new generation in this beautiful edition. From his lyrical introduction, describing the brand new world ("the flowers jumped up and stared around, astonished. Then . . . creatures began to appear"), Hughes moves on to tell his classic stories about how individual creatures came to be: the whale that began as a garden plant; the power-hungry owl ostracized by its peers; the handsome, clever cat, lazy but talented; and so on. Hughes balances these fantastic stories with a notion children will find inspiring: despite the fantastic stories, some animals became what they wanted to be simply by will and hard work ("Some wanted to become finches, some wanted to become lions, some wanted to become other things. The ones that wanted to become lions practiced at being lions--and by and by, sure enough, they began to turn into lions"). Hughes' prose, both comical and elegantly spare, finds a worthy match in Morris' lavish, detailed watercolors. Stunning spreads and border illustrations celebrate each animal's beauty, endowing the creatures with irresistible personalities (don't miss the lounging cat playing the violin), and extending the stories' comedy and soaring fancy. A volume to treasure. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Many poststructuralist and postmodernist practices can be traced to Deleuze&#39;s 1962 resurrection of Nietzsche against Hegel. Hardt shows how Deleuze&#39;s early analysis of Bergson&#39;s critique of ontology and determination led him to a conception of a positive movement of differentiation and becoming, which in turn led him to the field of forces, sense, value, and the thematic of power and affirmation in Nietzsche. The theory of power in Nietzsche provided the link for Deleuze to an ethics of active expression in Spinoza: Deleuze&#39;s discovery and analysis of Spinoza&#39;s cultivation of joy and practice at the center of ontology finally resulted in a complete break from the Hegelian paradigm that had reigned over continental philosophy and history.

Canadian author Hart has gleaned a remarkable amount of biographical detail from a careful (and obviously enjoyable) reading of the 12 books and 20 short stories featuring Christie's favorite female sleuth. After describing the village of St. Mary Mead, Hart recounts Miss Marple's life and adventures chronologically, then explores her personality and detection methods. This very readable study concludes with an extensive Marpelian bibliography. Recommended for fans and skeptics alike. Although very different in format and method, Morselt's book is another labor of love. One-page character and plot summaries are presented in separate chronological order for 66 novels and 144 short stories. These are numbered sequentially and followed by an appendix identifying "who-dunnits" tied in with the numerical keys, so that the mysteries aren't spoiled for the potential reader. Four indexes complete this unusual British import. Jeanne Gelinas, Hennepin Cty. Lib., Golden Valley, Minn.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Hart has done a careful job of sifting through all of Agatha Christie's stories and novels devoted to Miss Jane Marple to piece together this "biography" of the spinster detective. The book opens with a description of Miss Marple's hometown, St. Mary Mead, a village south of London. The reader is introduced to many of the residents, from the Vicar to the fishmonger's delivery boys (all of whom are named Fred). From the Marple works Hart extracts references to the detective's past, and reconstructs her girlhood and the genesis of her career. The author also follows Miss Marple through the 1930s and World War II, and describes her appearance and personality, daily routine, travels and relationships with relatives and friends. Though the casual reader of Christie mysteries may think this is a bit precious, Miss Marple zealots will find it charming, and a suitable companion to The Collected Stories, reviewed above.

Stimson was secretary of war under Taft, governor-general of the Philippines under Coolidge, secretary of state under Hoover and secretary of war again under FDR. The atom bombs were built and dropped under Stimson's supervision and authority. Born two years after Lincoln's assassination, he was brought up in the code of the Victorian gentleman, unashamedly elitist and dead certain that American world leadership was essential. He was also the living link between the foreign policies of 19th-century U.S. imperialism and the Cold War era. In his last act in public life, in 1947, he proposed the internationalization of nuclear technology in the hope that the Soviet Union could be persuaded not to start an arms race. The public figure as well as the private man are richly delineated in this elegant, learned biography, which offers deep insight into the process by which the U.S. emerged from the periphery of world events to the center of global power. Hodgson is the author of All Things to All Men. Photos . <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Stimson has few equals in American history. As Secretary of War on two occasions (1911-13, 1940-45) and Secretary of State (1929-33), Stimson's record is matched only by Timothy Pickering. He was at the seat of events from the "rise to world power" to the enshrinement of the Republic triumphant in 1945. He was intimate, insofar as such a reserved individual could be, with everyone who was anyone, from Theodore Roosevelt to Harry S. Truman. Yet despite his achievements and his voluminous papers, this work is only the second attempt at a personal assessment since Elting E. Morison's "official" biography ( Turmoil and Tradition, LJ 9/15/60). But if this new biography fills in some essential gaps and places Stimson within his historical context, it is also prolix, disapprobationary, and smacks more of journalistic muckraking than historical scholarship.<br><i>- J.K.

What, as a country, do we owe them? Cris Beam, a foster mother herself, spent five years immersed in the world of foster care, looking into these questions and tracing firsthand stories. The result is <i>To the End of June</i>, an unforgettable portrait that takes us deep inside the lives of foster children at the critical points in their search for a stable, loving family.<br><br>The book mirrors the life cycle of a foster child and so begins with the removal of babies and kids from birth families. There&#x2019;s a teenage birth mother in Texas who signs away her parental rights on a napkin only to later reconsider, crushing the hopes of her baby&#x2019;s adoptive parents. Beam then paints an unprecedented portrait of the intricacies of growing up in the system&#x2014;the back-and-forth with agencies, the shuffling between pre-adoptive homes and group homes, the emotionally charged tug of prospective adoptive parents and the fundamental pull of birth parents. And then what happens as these system-reared kids become adults? Beam closely follows a group of teenagers in New York who are grappling with what aging out will mean for them and meets a woman who has parented eleven kids from the system, almost all over the age of eighteen, and all still in desperate need of a sense of home and belonging.<br><br>Focusing intensely on a few foster families who are deeply invested in the system&#x2019;s success, <i>To the End of June</i> is essential for humanizing and challenging a broken system, while at the same time it is a tribute to resiliency and offers hope for real change.</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Cris Beam</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Why did you write this book?</strong></p> <p>A. I&#x2019;m a foster mother and, through my other books and reporting, I&#x2019;ve spent a lot of time with people impacted by the child welfare system. I was amazed that we could spend more than 20 billion dollars a year in this country on a system that nobody&#x2014;not the foster kids, not the foster or biological parents, not the social workers, not the administrators or commissioners&#x2014;thinks is working. I wanted to find out why.</p> <p><strong>Q. You adopted your foster daughter, Christina, when she was kicked out of her group home at age 17. Christina is 30 now. What is she up to these days? What is your relationship with her like?</strong></p> <p>A. Christina is an adult and she&#x2019;s pretty amazing. She lives in Los Angeles doing HIV outreach and education and goes to college at night. We&#x2019;re very close, we talk on the phone every other day or so. I feel so lucky, really, to have her in my life.</p> <p><strong>Q. You interviewed dozens of children, birth parents, foster parents, agency workers, and others in your five years of research. They all must have changed you in some way, but were there a few who especially stuck with you?</strong></p> <p>A. I spent several years tracking a set of parents in Brooklyn, Bruce and Allyson Green, who were particularly loving and dedicated. They did everything right: they took advantage of all the educational and extracurricular resources available to their foster kids, they loved their foster and biological kids equally, and when the time came, they adopted a girl named Fatimah and had done everything but sign the adoption papers with a girl named Dominique. Both of these girls were 17. Adoption is like the Holy Grail in foster care. In this case though, Fatimah and Dominique panicked. For so long, adoption had been held out as a kind of panacea to all of their prior trauma, and when adoption didn&#x2019;t fix their lives, they ran away, and ended up worse than before.</p> <p>I also followed a single mom in Yonkers named Mary who adopted much older kids, kids who had already aged out of the system and were technically adults. These kids also fell outside the fixed lens of child welfare, but they were helped tremendously by adoption. Sometimes the most creative solutions aren&#x2019;t happening within child welfare itself, but just at its edges.</p> <p><strong>Q. In what ways is the state of foster care in New York City reflective of the state of systems around the country? In what ways is it different?</strong></p> <p>A. New York&#x2019;s child welfare system is an enormous, overburdened bureaucracy with a thousand moving parts, all with different allegiances and poor intercommunication. It&#x2019;s this bureaucracy, rather than one bad director or singular mal intent, which is so destructive. You&#x2019;ll see this Kafka-esque quality everywhere. Also, as with our jails and prisons, child welfare is becoming increasingly privatized&#x2014;in New York and across the country&#x2014;and this has both useful, and problematic, implications. As far as foster care implementation, New York is somewhere in the middle: there are cities and states with far higher caseloads or longer delays to family reunification, and there are places that do a better job.</p> <p><strong>Q. About how many children are in foster care in the U.S. this year?</strong></p> <p>A. The last data we have is from July 2012, and there were 400,540 kids in foster care. The numbers have gone down significantly in the last 15 years, thanks to the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act, but the numbers have also changed. We&#x2019;re seeing the youngest kids getting adopted, but more teenagers than ever are aging out of the system with no resources at all.</p> <p><strong>Q. Are there any numbers on what percentage of kids in foster care are eventually adopted?</strong></p> <p>A. It's important to remember that the central goal of foster care is to reunite kids with their birth parents, and in any given year about half of the kids will go home. The trouble is really with the trauma they endure during the separation, shuffling their way through multiple strangers' homes&#x2014;on average, for close to two years.</p> <p>There are biological parents who can&#x2019;t or won&#x2019;t care for their children, though, and last year about 50,000 foster kids were adopted from foster care and 100,000 foster kids were waiting for prospective parents. On average, the adopted kids had been in foster care for three years and then waited another year to be adopted. But these are averages: some kids will wait much longer, or never be adopted at all. And these figures don&#x2019;t even include the tens of thousands of kids 16 and older who have given up hope for adoption entirely, deciding to just wait for emancipation from the system as adults.</p> <p><strong>Q. Why don&#x2019;t we hear more about these kids?</strong></p> <p>A. For one, people are afraid to read about child abuse. It&#x2019;s painful and frightening to think about kids being harmed. In reality, though, the vast majority of kids are removed from their families not for abuse but for neglect&#x2014;and many argue that &#x201c;neglect&#x201d; is a code word for &#x201c;poor.&#x201d; We can look at poverty with a more direct gaze, so this may be a way to open the conversation more.</p> <p>Secondly, there&#x2019;s a kind of fait accompli attitude around foster care and foster kids in general; we don&#x2019;t see it as the dynamic, changeable, and changing system that it really is. </p> <p><strong>Q. Since 2006, Florida&#x2019;s foster care system has been funded differently from other states&#x2019;. Their system was recognized as a possible model for other states by President Obama in 2011. What makes Florida unusual? Should other states adopt their way?</strong></p> <p>Traditionally, and in most states, foster care is funded on a per diem basis: agencies get a certain dollar amount from the federal and state government for every day a child stays in a foster or group home. This financial structure provides a kind of perverse incentive to remove kids from their parents. In 2006, Florida accepted a flat fee, called a waiver, for five years. This meant they only had to remove kids from the most dangerous households and then could spend the rest of the money on things like abuse prevention, drug rehabilitation, and keeping the family stable and secure. Thirty states and counties have now applied for similar waivers, promising a sea change in the way we think about, and approach, child welfare overall. I think it&#x2019;s quite promising and exciting.</p><p>HMH&nbsp;hardcover, 2013, previous ISBN 978-0-15-101412-5</p></p><h2>Precious Remedies Against Satan&#39;s Devices</h2><p>Thomas Brooks was a 17th century English non-conformist Puritan preacher. Amongst Brooks most famous writings is Precious Remedies Against Satan&#39;s Devices which illustrates how a struggling sinner can avoid the temptation that can lead down a wretched path.</p><p>Little is known about Thomas Brooks as a man, other than can be ascertained from his many writings. Born, probably of well-to-do parents, in 1608, Brooks entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1625. He was licensed as a preacher of the gospel by 1640 at the latest. Before that date he seems to have spent a number of years at sea, probably as a chaplain with the fleet. After the Civil War, Brooks became minister at Thomas Apostle s, London, and was sufficiently renowned to be chosen as preacher before the House of Commons on 26 December, 1648. Three or four years later he moved to St Margaret s, Fish-street Hill, London, but encountered considerable opposition as he refused baptism and the Lord s Supper to those clearly unworthy of such privileges. The following years were filled with written as well as spoken ministry. In 1662 he fell victim to the notorious Act of Uniformity, but he appears to have remained in his parish and to have preached the Word as opportunity offered. Treatises continued to flow from his agile pen. In 1677 or 1678 he married for the second time, &#39;she spring-young, he winter-old&#39;. Two years later he went home to his Lord.'Not only did the book help me in the area of dealing with Christians in my own soul - relating to doubt or assurance - it also helped me in application, in preaching. In fact, [Precious Remedies] may have helped me in application in preaching more than any other book I've ever read.' --<i>Ligon Duncan</i></p><h2>Immortal (Fallen Angels)</h2><p>From J.R.

Ward</p><p></p><p></p><p>Acknowledgments</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter <br>One</p><p>Sometimes a girl just needed a new pair of kicks.</p><p>As the demon Devina strode through the Freidmont Hotel&#x2019;s lobby, she was all about the good feels, strutting it large, hinging those hips. In her mind, her thoughts were locked on last-night action. On her body, she wore skintight leather from her double-Ds to her size nines and all the acreage in between. And talk about pheromones&#x2014;if she put out any more of them, her fuck-me aura would burn holes through the paneled walls.</p><p>Eyes followed her. Men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s. But why wouldn&#x2019;t they? Caldwell, New York, wasn&#x2019;t that far from NYC, and famous people came up all the time from the Big Apple. Besides, even though they didn&#x2019;t recognize her from movies or TV, she was still a world-class beauty.</p><p>At least in this current suit of flesh.</p><p>Back to the shoes.</p><p>She was heading to the revolving doors, crossing that smooth stretch of shiny, creamy marble, when she saw the stilettos&#x2014;and stopped dead. Under a Plexiglas case, as if they were jewels, the pair of golden Louboutins was spotlit from above, and oh, the loveliness: The entire skin of each of them was covered in a million micro Swarovski crystals, until their surface looked liquid. And the style? Razor-thin heels that were high enough to put you <i>en pointe</i>. Tiny toe box to show off the cleav. Hidden platforms to provide support on the ball of the foot.</p><p>And the capper was, of course, the red sole, the underside of the heels flashing the color of a candied apple.</p><p>It was love at first sight.</p><p>&#x201c;Madam, would you like to try these on?&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t even look at the man who&#x2019;d materialized beside her. OCD was a disease of capture, and its hooks were once again nailing her in the heart. Even though she had nearly a thousand pairs in her wardrobe, the idea that she couldn&#x2019;t have this particular twosome, that someone or something might get in the way of her possessing them and keeping them, made her chest tight, her palms sweaty, and her blood flutter through her veins.</p><p>&#x201c;Madam?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she breathed. &#x201c;Size nine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come with me.&#x201d;</p><p>She followed like a lamb, looking over her shoulder to double-check that the shoes were still where she&#x2019;d seen them. Worse came to worst, she could always just steal them&#x2014;</p><p>In the back of her mind, a whoaaaaaaaaaa-Nelly rang out. For the past year, she&#x2019;d been going to therapy to try to stop these kinds of tailspins.</p><p>Calm the fuck down, Devina. It&#x2019;s just a shoe. It&#x2019;s only&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>It is not going to solve your problems with Jim.</p><p>Okay, now she felt like throwing up.</p><p>FFS, what was she supposed to say to herself? She tried to remember the combination of words that was supposed to put this out-of-control need into a healthier perspective, but there was a traffic jam in her system of neuro-highways. All she could think of was, Get it, keep it, count it.</p><p>Get it, keep it, count it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Get it, keep it, count it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Damn it, this was a big step back. Thanks to that fully actualized, post-menopausal woman with the PhD on her wall and the couch-cushion body, Devina had been making headway with the compulsions. But this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this was old-school, and not in a good way. </p><p>And yeah, she knew why this was happening.</p><p>It was easier to think about the shoes.</p><p>The boutique was in the rear of the lobby, and as she walked through the glass-and-marble entrance, the scented air did nothing to ease the burn. The only thing that was going to help was&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Was that a nine?&#x201d; the salesman asked.</p><p>Devina shot a glare over. Mr. Can&#x2019;t Remmy a Damn Shoe Size had a good suit on and a silk tie, and his salt-and-pepper hair was sculpted back from his Botox&#x2019;d forehead. Turned out the sophisticated fragrance in the place was his cologne, and as he fiddled with his handkerchief, his nails were buffed to a high shine.</p><p>He was too put-together to kill. And besides, how would she get her shoes then?</p><p>&#x201c;Nine,&#x201d; she said sharply. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a nine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very good, madam. Would you care for a mimosa?&#x201d;</p><p>No, I want my fucking shoes. &#x201c;Thank you, no.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very good.&#x201d;</p><p>Left to her own devices, she paced around the fake Aubusson and checked out the other high-ends you could buy. Judith Leiber minaudi�res. More shoes, but nothing she was panting to have. Akris jackets. St. John knits. Armani dresses.</p><p>Catching sight of herself in one of the many mirrors, she checked out her own ass&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and thought back to how she&#x2019;d spent the night.</p><p>Her one true love had banged the shit out of her. They&#x2019;d had about eight hours of epic sex up in her suite, just like she&#x2019;d wanted. And the fact that the entire time he&#x2019;d hated himself for it? Icing on the cake.</p><p>Jim Heron was a hell of a lover.</p><p>Tragically, that wasn&#x2019;t the only thing he was&#x2014;and therein lay the problem. He was a cheater. He was a liar. And he didn&#x2019;t understand the concept of monogamy: Even after their incredible night? He&#x2019;d gone back home to someone else.</p><p>And God, the idea that that virgin Sissy was the competition? Now that shit made her want to buy everything in this store. Even the crap that didn&#x2019;t fit her.</p><p>As she started to estimate the cost, item by item, she stopped herself and tried to placate her OCD with the reality that she was leading three rounds to two in the war over humanity&#x2014;so if she won the battle for this current soul? By the rules the Creator had set up, she got everything: Not only did she keep her precious collections and her children down in Hell, but she gained dominion over the earth as well as Heaven above.</p><p>For someone hardwired like her, it was a wet dream unparalleled, a winning Powerball lottery ticket with a jackpot in the hundreds of billions.</p><p>You wanna talk about shoe collections? She could enslave Manolo, Stuie, Christian&#x2014;and get them to make nothing but footwear for her for time immemorial.</p><p>But even better, she&#x2019;d get Jim&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Madam, I am so sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>Devina turned around. Mr. Manicure had come out from the back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but didn&#x2019;t have a box in his hand. &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have only the size eight. I can order&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The man cleared his throat. Twice. Then he opened his mouth to try to breathe. Brought his carefully tended hands up to his carefully knotted tie. Went walleyed.</p><p>&#x201c;You were saying?&#x201d; Devina drawled.</p><p>A little clicking sound came out of him as he tried to remain composed while failing to bring air into his lungs.</p><p>But damn it, if she killed him, how would she find the shoes in the back?</p><p>Devina released the invisible pressure. &#x201c;Bring me the eights.&#x201d;</p><p>The man wheezed and threw a hand out to catch himself on the Leiber display, knocking a couple of the hard sparklies off their posts.</p><p>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; she barked, flashing her eyes at him.</p><p>Cue the shuffling across that rug. And the instant he was behind the silk curtain, the round of coughing and wheezing was like an asthmatic in a greenhouse. But he did emerge with a beige-colored box about two minutes and thirty-nine seconds later. Not that she was counting.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t hear a word he said as he approached, her eyes locked on what was in his hands. There was a temptation to snatch the shit out of his grip, but she wanted to see the shoes on her feet, even if they didn&#x2019;t go with her outfit.</p><p>Although, dayum, Swarovski and black leather was classic.</p><p>Devina hit the row of three damask-covered chairs and kicked off her black Guccis. &#x201c;Give them to me now.&#x201d;</p><p>The box came to her on command and her hands shook as she popped the top and sighed. The pair of red bags with Louboutin&#x2019;s black signature on them were a sight to behold and her hands shook as she took one out and pulled open the drawstring. Then&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, what a beauty.</p><p>The gem-like twinkling was better than those little purses. Better than what she&#x2019;d seen out in the lobby through the display case. And the color was that of Caucasian flesh.</p><p>Jim&#x2019;s flesh.</p><p>She closed her eyes reverently and sent up a prayer for the salesman to keep quiet&#x2014;if he said one thing about her feet being too big, she was going to take his head off, and not verbally.</p><p>With care, she un-bagged the other one and lined up both shoes side by side on the floor. Then she released the structure of her feet so that as she slid her tootsies into the works of art, her bones and skin were like water filling a vase, nothing but accommodation.</p><p>The salesman seemed a little surprised as she stood up and walked around all comfy-comfy, but he wasn&#x2019;t going to say boo, and how lucky for him. Plus, come on, the Loubous were what, like nearly five grand? And he had to be on commission.</p><p>Devina smiled as she stared down at her feet, a flush of giddy relief wiping away all the angst about Jim and the war and that fucking Sissy. All at once she was glowing from the inside out, as if she&#x2019;d had a rip-roaring orgasm, a hot-fudge sundae, and a deep tissue massage all at once.</p><p>These were the most perfect shoes in the entire world, and they were hers and nobody else&#x2019;s, and she was taking them to her wardrobe right now&#x2014;</p><p>That bell in the back of her head rang again, the one that told her when she was backsliding. But screw that.</p><p>The stillies were epic, and she couldn&#x2019;t wait for Jim to see her in &#x2019;em. Preferably while the rest of her was nakey.</p><p>Yup, these she would save for him.</p><p>Popping them off her feet, she put them back into the box just as they&#x2019;d been presented to her and double-checked to make sure the little red bag with the extra heel tips was in there. Then she glanced over at the salesman&#x2014;who was taking a discreet puff from an inhaler.</p><p>&#x201c;Put them on my tab,&#x201d; she said triumphantly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the penthouse.&#x201d;</p><p>When your man went home to another, retail therapy was the only way to go.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter<br>Two</p><p>Standing over a white-and-blue bowl, Sissy Barten cracked an egg so hard, the shell didn&#x2019;t just shatter but vaporized. <i>&#x201c;</i>Oh, come<i> on.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Turning to the sink, she cranked on the water and cleaned off her hand. Which was shaking. Actually, her whole body was shaking, like her spine was a fault line and everything else was in danger of going the way of that egg.</p><p>As she cranked off the faucet, the old mansion got way too quiet, and with a jerk, she looked over her shoulder. Hairs prickled across the back of her neck, warning her of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what? There were no footfalls, no screams, nobody with a knife or a gun stalking her.</p><p>Great. Guess immortals could lose their minds. And wasn&#x2019;t that a happy future to look forward to.</p><p>You couldn&#x2019;t kill yourself if you were already dead.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn it,&#x201d; she whispered.</p><p>Drying her hands, she grabbed the bowl and washed the thing out. Then she went back to the carton and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Stalled completely. She didn&#x2019;t want to make scrambled eggs for herself. She didn&#x2019;t want to be stuck in this house. She didn&#x2019;t want to be dead and separated from her family.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>And while she was at it? She really, totally, absolutely did <i>not</i> want to have that image of Jim Heron half-naked in her head. The sight of him coming out of that bathroom in the wee hours of the night, a towel around his waist, a wasted expression on his face, was like a billboard in front of her brain. She saw every nuance of his body, those huge shoulders, the tight abs, the tops of his hip bones, and that little line of hair beneath his belly button.</p><p>Mostly, though, she saw the scratches in his smooth skin. There had been three sets of them, and there was only one thing that could have made&#x2014;</p><p>Abruptly, her shaking got worse, and she tried to do something about it by cracking each one of her knuckles.</p><p>Okay, this was ridiculous. You&#x2019;d think, given her current r�sum� of being a sacrificial dead-ass virgin resurrected from Hell into a war between a pair of fallen angels and a real, live, honest-to-God demon, that the main thing on her mind would not be some guy. Then again, reality had gone wonky on her weeks ago, so could she really be surprised&#x2014;</p><p>She wheeled around.</p><p>No one was there. Again. No one was moving in the house or outside on the scruffy grounds. Adrian, the other fallen angel, had gone up to sleep in the attic where he stayed. And Jim? Jim was on the second floor, doing REM recovery from his night of pneumatic sex.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Bracing her hands on either side of the bowl, she leaned into her arms. In spite of her rising paranoia, fear wasn&#x2019;t responsible for her case of the paint mixers.</p><p>The urge to kill was.</p><p>And that was only a liiiiittle hyperbole. Because her half-naked, towel-wrapped savior had gotten those scratches on his body from a woman&#x2019;s fingernails. And his mouth had been swollen not from getting coldcocked in a fight, but because he&#x2019;d been kissing someone. A lot. And his walk-of-shame expression?</p><p>Well, that was on account of his clearly having banged someone for hours instead of doing his job. Which just made her furious. Angels responsible for making sure good prevailed over evil? In a war like this? Generally speaking, keeping their eye on the ball was a better idea than being with some whore for hours.</p><p>Or, God, maybe she was a nice woman. Who, like, cooked for him as well as gave him great blow jobs.</p><p>The more she thought about it, the angrier she got.</p><p>Did he have a girlfriend? Well, obviously&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. although maybe that was naive of her. Did men have girlfriends? College students did&#x2014;but Jim was faaaaaar from one of those&#x2014;</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder for a third time. But nope, Jim was not coming through the doorway. Nobody was.</p><p>Hell, for all she knew, he&#x2019;d already left to have coffee with his&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop it. Just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>stop</i> it.&#x201d;</p><p>As her rage level went up another decibel, it felt like an eternity since she&#x2019;d been a college student taking her mom&#x2019;s car out to the local Hannaford for some ice cream&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. aeons since she&#x2019;d been approached there by&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t remember that part. Couldn&#x2019;t re-create exactly what series of events had brought her to her mortal end, but she recalled everything that came after that: the viscous walls of Hell, the tortured damned twisting around her, her own pain turning her ancient.</p><p>Jim Heron had ended up down there, too&#x2014;for a time. And Sissy had seen what the demon did to him. Had watched those shadowy minions do&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. horrible things to his body.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit.&#x201d;</p><p>All things considered, she should cut him some slack, right? He was a victim in all this, too, wasn&#x2019;t he? So if, in the midst of this war, the man wanted to get a little grind, lose himself in someone, have a break from the horror and the pressure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what business was it of hers?</p><p>The guy had gotten her out of Hell, and for that solid, she owed him. But that didn&#x2019;t give her the right to get all hot and bothered about him having gotten all hot and bothered with someone else. </p><p>Although granted, there was a lot at stake&#x2014;if he lost, her own pare...</p></p><h2>Glyph</h2><p>With this inventive and humorous novel, Percival Everett has created his unlikeliest hero to date.

He continues to amaze me with each novel-- as if he likes making 90 degree turns to see what's around the corner, and then over the edge. I think he has a following, but not large enough.

It tells the story, through an interwoven plot, of the clash between old traditions and growing desires.</p><p>ISRAEL JOSHUA SINGER (1893-1944), the brother of Nobel Prize-winner Isaac Bashevis Singer, was born in Bilgoraj, Poland, the son of a rabbi. He contributed to Yiddish newspapers in Warsaw and Kiev, where his short story, ''Pearls,'' was published, which brought him immediate recognition. In 1921 he was hired as a correspondent for the <i>Jewish Daily Forward</i>. In 1927 he wrote his first novel, <i>Steel and Iron</i>, which was followed five years later by <i>Yoshe Kalb</i>. He came to the United States in 1934, and within two years <i>The Brothers Ashkenzai</i> was published, a work that was not only an instant success but was also destined to become a classic in its time.The children loved the yard, no one more so than Jacob Bunem.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Sima Meir,&#x201d; he would cry in a loud voice that expressed his lust for life, &#x201c;come play tag.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to,&#x201d; Simha Meir would say brusquely and turn away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twins didn&#x2019;t get along.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob Bunem would have preferred it otherwise. He was bigger, stronger, full of laughter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Jacob Bunem, why do you always laugh?&#x201d; others asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Cause I feel like it,&#x201d; he would say, and laugh again so that the others felt compelled to join in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his whole heart and soul into the childish games. No one could run faster, or find better hiding places in the foundation when they played hide and seek, or catch the ends of the cord the roper dragged through the courtyard. He could excavate the biggest rocks and raise them overhead. He never grew tired of the games. Not only did he enjoy playing, but he wanted everyone, especially his brother, to do the same. But Simha Meir would have none of it.</p><h2>Forgotten No More: The Korean War Veterans Memorial Story</h2><p>The Korean War Veterans Memorial Story.

As Rose learned, you don't have to live through an unhappy childhood or celebrity adulthood to write an autobiography. You just need patience, candor, and a close-to-scientific passion for truth. She begins to learn how to navigate the intricacies of Proust's novels, at the same time reflecting on the course of her own life.<br><br>With striking honesty, Rose writes about marriage, friendship, childbirth, and her own mortality. As she moves from daily experience to what she's read and back again, she illuminates how the close reading of her own life reveals truths for the rest of us and how such a subtle celebration of books can help us live.</p><p>"For a long time I used to try to read Proust," recalls Phyllis Rose, evoking both the somnolent opening salvo of <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i> and her own resistance to that mighty, melancholic masterpiece. Happily, she did get around to it. And even better, she recorded her dogged progress through all seven installments--and her own, shall we say, parallel life--in <i>The Year of Reading Proust: A Memoir in Real Time</i>. The result is an irresistible hybrid of autobiography, rumination, and lit crit, in which the author puts one Proustian principle after another into action. Some of these efforts end up backfiring on Rose. For example, her attempt to tar a friend with the French novelist's paradoxical brush causes her some deep embarrassment: <blockquote> Paradox always leads you to a sort of truth, for it gets at truth's many-sidedness. But the tone of what I wrote David, although it amused him, was not Proustian. There's a sweetness that comes with complex understanding, and I didn't have it. The bitterness of my sterility flowed into the style, creating of Annie, whom I sometimes loved, sometimes scorned, sometimes envied, sometimes resented, sometimes relished, and sometimes pitied, a creature of blanket unattractiveness and of myself uncomplicated malice. </blockquote> Here, of course, the author is being hard on herself, articulating precisely the sort of complexity that she's supposed to be incapable of. The paradox might evoke a faint smile from Proust himself--who also might have relished the pinpoint social observation and relentless honesty of Rose's book. Whether she's recording a late-breaking entente between herself and her mother, or the details of a dinner party for blaspheming bad boy Salman Rushdie, or her own career disappointments, the author withholds nothing. At the same time, she delivers any number of big-picture truths, occasionally wrapping them in you-know-who's favorite sort of simile: "As at a big party, you approach people you haven't seen in a long time with benevolence and perhaps a little too much joy, fearing that you've forgotten how close you were, in a long friendship, you might approach your friend with a tentativeness and uncertainty unwarranted by the degree of affection you feel for her, but understandable in the light of human forgetfulness and the complexity of your particular exchanges." It's all here--generosity, mortification, high intelligence, and top-quality gossip, along with enough Proustian moments to last any reader <i>at least</i> a year. <i>--James Marcus</i>Phyllis Rose is the author of <i>Parallel Lives</i> and <i>Jazz Cleopatra</i>, among other books, and the editor of <i>The Norton Book of Women's Lives</i>.

He has taught at San Diego State University as well as the University of London, the University of Paris, the Hahn-Meitner Institute for Nuclear Physics in Berlin, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is a member of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Collegium of Scholars, and the author of eleven books including <i>Mind into Matter</i> and <i>Taking the Quantum Leap</i>, for which he received the National Book Award.Wolf's readers should get ready for a wild intellectual ride through the convoluted realms of quantum mechanics, relativity, black holes and imaginary time. The physicist ( Starwave ) is a strong proponent of the "many-worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics, and he launches a ferocious assault on conservative scientists who espouse the "Copenhagen" interpretation. Essentially, the debate hinges on the role of consciousness in measuring quantum events: Copenhagenists argue that a quantum measurement causes the "collapse" of a particle's probability wave, while Wolf claims the act of measuring actually causes the universe to split in two. The equations of relativity and quantum physics support both interpretations. Wolf describes what it would be like to travel through a black hole to a parallel universe; claims that the future must communicate with the present; answers the question of whether the universe had a radius before we started to measure it; and argues that schizophrenics may be in touch with parallel universes.

Widowed Christina Parr, her daughter Morgan, and her brother-in-law Jeremy have returned to the remote northern Ontario mining town of Parr&#39;&#39;s Landing, the place from which Christina fled before Morgan was born, seeking refuge. Dr. Billy Lightning has also returned in search of answers to the mystery of his father&#39;&#39;s brutal murder. All will find some part of what they seek-and more. Built on the site of a decimated 17th-century Jesuit mission to the Ojibwa, Parr&#39;&#39;s Landing is a town with secrets of its own buried in the caves around Bradley Lake. A three-hundred-year-old horror slumbers there, calling out to the insane and the murderous for centuries, begging for release-an invitation that has finally been answered. One man is following that voice, cutting a swath of violence across the country, bent on a terrible resurrection of the ancient evil, plunging the town and all its people into an endless night. &#34;Enter, Night is so rich and assured it&#39;&#39;s hard to believe it&#39;&#39;s Michael Rowe&#39;&#39;s first novel.

Des Barres, and the Making of The Atlantic Neptune (Volume 221) (Carleton Library Series)</h2><p>British imperial power was greatly bolstered by new techniques in surveying and map-making during the eighteenth century. Well before James Cook sailed for the Pacific in 1768, British army engineers working on the coastline from Quebec to Rhode Island had set new scientific standards for cartography that would assist the British in mapping future conquests. Surveyors of Empire explores the groundbreaking work of these engineers, which formed the basis of The Atlantic Neptune, a four-volume hydrographic atlas that stands as a monument of European Enlightenment science. Using research from both sides of the Atlantic, Stephen Hornsby examines the development of British military cartography in North America during and after the Seven Years War, as well as advancements in military and scientific equipment used in surveying. At the same time, he follows the land speculation of two leading surveyors, Samuel Holland and J.F.W. Des Barres, and the publication history of The Atlantic Neptune. Richly illustrated with images from The Atlantic Neptune and earlier maps, Surveyors of Empire is an insightful account of the relationship between science and imperialism, and the British shaping of the Atlantic world.</p><p>Stephen J.

With the rise of capitalism, many disciplines grew increasingly specialized and self-determined. However, the art world proves an especially fascinating case, as artists both catered to and anticipated appetites and values which are standard in culture today. The book is arranged around broad "inventions," such as art as a form of therapy for nerves jangled by mechanization, or bohemianism as a fashionable, slightly ridiculous, expression of repressed, or simply impractical bourgeois desires. Among the most interesting chapters are those that address the complicated, ultimately confused gender roles artists grappled with. They were, on the one hand, negatively perceived as (feminine) aesthetes operating outside of, yet dependent on, the (masculine) realms of business and finance. But artists were also the ultimate entrepreneurs: William Merritt Chase's famously opulent studio became a working model of commercial success, while Winslow Homer's rugged pictures and personae spoke to his robber-baron clientele in near-Darwinian terms of survival. How "the great woman painter," as Cecilia Beaux was dubbed, navigated her own success is delicate indeed. The author, an art historian at Indiana University, draws on an entertaining range of sources in period fiction, philosophy, politics and 130 illustrations in a scholarly, bright and highly readable effort. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gay Place, Being Three Related Novels: The Flea Circus, Room Enough to Caper, Country Pleasures.

Boyer has invented an imaginary navigation company and told its story, based upon the similar histories of real canals. He explains why canals were essential to westward expansion and how the development of railroads greatly reduced their usefulness. Emphasis is placed on the technology that was needed to construct these canals. Perhaps he goes into too much detail here for most students; although the pencil diagrams and illustrations are attractive, they sometimes do not readily clarify the complicated mechanics discussed in the text. A brief explanation of life on the canals rounds out the text. The list of sites where remains of canals, locks and dams may be viewed is a thoughtful addition.

With a new foreword, the wisdom of the 7 Habits still holds true after all these years. The 7 Habits have become so famous because they work. They have been integrated into everyday thinking by many millions of people. The reason: They work. Habit 1: Be Proactive. Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind. Habit 3: Put First Things First. Habit 4: Think Win/Win. Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood. Habit 6: Synergize. Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw. The book presents a principle-centered approach for solving personal and professional problems. With penetrating insights and pointed anecdotes, Covey reveals a step-by-step pathway for living with fairness, integrity, honesty and human dignity - principles that give us the security to adapt to change and the wisdom and power to take advantage of the opportunities that change creates.</p><p>Anyone who thinks the audiocassette adaptation of Stephen Covey's bestseller, <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>, is a shortcut to reading the book has another thing coming. As a preview, the cassette is worth every one of its 90 minutes; as a substitute for the original, it will only leave you wishing for the rest. There's a reason <i>7 Habits</i> has sold more than 5 million copies and been translated into 32 languages. Serious work has obviously gone into it, and serious change can likely come out of it--but only with constant discipline and steadfast commitment. As the densely packed tape makes immediately clear, this is no quick fix for what's ailing us in our personal and professional lives.<p> The tape opens to the silky-smooth, overtrained voice of the female narrator, who's responsible for tying together audio clips from actual Covey seminars. Leaving aside the occasional attempts at promoting Covey and his institute, her script does a first-rate job of making sense of Covey's own intense, analogy-rich style of explaining his habits. There's nothing simple about his approach to becoming an effective person. The first three habits alone--which have to do with personal responsibility, leadership, and self-management--could take years to master. Yet the last four are unattainable, the narrator insists, if you can't acquire the personal security--the "inner core," says Covey--that presumably comes from a mastery of the foundation.</p><p> Throughout our lessons, Covey's presence is both learned and thoroughly appealing. He drops references to the likes of Socrates, T.S. Eliot, and Robert Frost with the aplomb of an English professor. And his knack for mixing everyday stories with abstract concepts manages to clarify difficult issues while respecting our intelligence. You could argue that the cassette is nothing more than a clever marketing tool for selling another few million copies of the book. But, even at that, it's worth the investment in time and concentration: in the end, we're moved to learn more about integrating all seven habits in our struggle to become better and, yes, more effective people. (Running time: 1.5 hours, one cassette) <i>--Ann Senechal</i></p><i>The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People</i> is a comprehensive program based on developing an awareness of how perceptions and assumptions hinder success---in business as well as presonal relationships. Here's an approach that will help broaden your way of thinking and lead to greater opportunities and effective problem solving. Be Pro-Active: Take the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen. Begin With an End in Mind: Start with a clear destination to understand where you are now, where you're going and what you value most. Put First Things First: Manage yourself. Organize and execute around priorities. Think Win/Win: See life as a cooperative, not a comprehensive arena where success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. Seek First to Understand: Understand then be understood to build the skills of empathetic listening that inspires openness and trust. Synergize: Apply the principles of cooperative creativity and value differences. Renewal: Preserving and enhanving your greatest asset, yourself, by renewing the physical, spiritual, mental and social/emotional dimensions of your nature. Stephen R. Covey is the most respected motivator in the business world today.

At various times in the past, Shermer has believed in fundamentalist Christianity, alien abductions, Ayn Rand, megavitamin therapy, and deep-tissue massage. Now he believes in skepticism, and his motto is "<i>Cognite tute</i>--think for yourself." This updated edition of <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i> covers Holocaust denial and creationism in considerable detail, and has chapters on abductions, Satanism, Afrocentrism, near-death experiences, Randian positivism, and psychics. Shermer has five basic answers to the implied question in his title: for consolation, for immediate gratification, for simplicity, for moral meaning, and because hope springs eternal. He shows the kinds of errors in thinking that lead people to believe weird (that is, unsubstantiated) things, especially the built-in human need to see patterns, even where there is no pattern to be seen. Throughout, Shermer emphasizes that skepticism (in his sense) does not need to be cynicism: "Rationality tied to moral decency is the most powerful joint instrument for good that our planet has ever known." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i><p><b>Michael Shermer</b> is the author of <i>The Believing Brain</i>, <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i>, <i>The Science of Good and Evil</i>, <i>The Mind Of The Market</i>, <i>Why Darwin Matters</i>, <i>Science Friction</i>, <i>How We Believe</i> and other books on the evolution of human beliefs and behavior.

Ambrose reveals for the first time anywhere that the intricate plan for the invasion of France in June 1944 had to be abandoned before the first shot was fired. The true story of D-Day, as Ambrose relates it, is about the citizen soldiers - junior officers and enlisted men - taking the initiative to act on their own to break through Hitler&#39;s Atlantic Wall when they realised that nothing was as they had been told it would be. D-DAY is the brilliant, no holds barred, telling of the battles of Omaha and Utah beaches. Ambrose relives the epic victory of democracy on the most important day of the twentieth century.</p><p>Published to mark the 50th anniversary of the invasion of Normandy, Stephen E. Ambrose's <i>D-Day: June 6, 1944</i> relies on over 1,400 interviews with veterans, as well as prodigious research in military archives on both sides of the Atlantic. He provides a comprehensive history of the invasion which also eloquently testifies as to how common soldiers performed extraordinary feats. A major theme of the book, upon which Ambrose would later expand in <i>Citizen Soldiers</i>, is how the soldiers from the democratic Allied nations rose to the occasion and outperformed German troops thought to be invincible. The many small stories that Ambrose collected from paratroopers, sailors, infantrymen, and civilians make the excitement, confusion, and sheer terror of D-day come alive on the page. <i>--Robert McNamara</i>Stephen E.

He died in 2002.</p><h2>Early Times in Texas; or, The Adventures of Jack Dobell</h2><p>In 1835, Texas offered young men like John C. Duval a chance for action and glory. That year he and his brother, Burr, the sons of a former governor of Florida, organized a volunteer company called the "Mustangs." Like Davy Crockett, they were fired up "to give the Texans a helping hand on the road to freedom" from Mexican rule. The first chapters of <i>Early Times in Texas</i> lead up to the Goliad Massacre on Palm Sunday 1836, in which Burr (referred to as Captain D&#x2014;) was killed. John was luckier. After a hair-raising escape from Goliad, he wandered across the countryside, dodging the Mexicans and living by his wits.&nbsp;&nbsp;The diary that Duval kept during these exciting months was the basis for <i>Early Times in Texas</i>, which was published more than fifty years later, in 1892. In the intervening years he was a Ranger known as "Texas John" and later was recognized as one of Texas's first men of letters, the author of <i>The Adventures of Big-Foot Wallace</i></p><p></p><h2>Aunt Dimity and the Widow&#39;s Curse (Aunt Dimity Mystery)</h2><p><p><br><b>Nancy Atherton's twenty-second cozy mystery in the beloved, nationally bestselling Aunt Dimity series.</b> <br><br>It's early April in the small English village of Finch. Lori Shepherd's husband and sons are spending Easter break camping, and Lori is perfectly happy to be left at home with Bess, spared a week of roughing it with a curious toddler. The two attend a village events committee meeting and Lori is astonished when the elderly, soft-spoken widow Mrs. Annabelle Craven stands to make an announcement: she's decided to hold a quilting bee in the old schoolhouse. <br><br>At the quilting bee, Lori ends up seated beside Mrs. Craven, delighted at the opportunity to learn more about her neighbor's life in the village of Old Cowerton. But dear, sweet Mrs. Craven's stories reveal a startling secret about her first husband's death. <br><br>With Aunt Dimity's advice, Lori sets out to learn the truth about what the residents of Old Cowerton refer to as the "widow's curse"--and the deeper she digs, the more horrifying the tale becomes, until she discovers the most astounding revelation of all.</p><p>Watch out for Atherton's latest, <i><b>Aunt Dimity and the King's Ransom</b></i>, coming out in July 2018!</p></p><p>Nancy Atherton is the bestselling author of twenty-two Aunt Dimity Mysteries. The first book in the series, <i>Aunt Dimity's Death</i>, was voted "One of the Century's 100 Favorite Mysteries" by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. She lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.One<br><br> Annabelle Craven was an ideal neighbor. Quiet, tidy, and unfailingly polite, she was the sort of neighbor who could be relied upon to lend a frantic baker a cup of sugar or to water a window box while its owner was away on holiday.<br><br> No one knew Mrs. Craven's exact age. She never mentioned it, and it would have been impertinent to inquire, but anyone with eyes could see that she was elderly. Her tweed skirts and blazers hung loosely on her shrunken frame, her soft gray eyes peered out from a face webbed with wrinkles, and she wore her long white hair in a wispy bun on the back of her head. Her tweed skirts and blazers were elderly, too, as were her sensible shoes, but her clothes were well made and well kept and would in all likelihood outlast her.<br><br> Mrs. Craven was in remarkably good health for a woman of her advanced years. Her eyesight was undimmed, her hearing was excellent, and her nimble fingers could undo knots that defeated much younger women. She moved slowly but surely, without the aid of a cane or a walker, and everyone who knew her agreed that her mind was as agile as her fingers. She could hold her own in any conversation and she wasn't the least bit forgetful. If Mrs. Craven made an appointment, she kept it.<br><br> Mrs. Craven lived in Finch, a small and somnolent village set among the rolling hills and the patchwork fields of the Cotswolds, a pastoral haven described in countless guidebooks as one of the prettiest regions in England.<br><br> I agreed with the guidebooks. My family and I lived near Finch, in a honey-colored cottage on a narrow winding lane lined with tall hedgerows. Although my husband, Bill, and I were Americans, as were our twin sons and our daughter, we'd lived in England long enough to develop a minor addiction to scones, clotted cream, and strawberry jam.<br><br> We kept our addiction in check by leading full and busy lives. Bill ran the European branch of his family's venerable Boston law firm from an office overlooking the village green; our ten-year-old sons, Will and Rob, attended Morningside School in the nearby market town of Upper Deeping; and I juggled the challenging roles of wife, mother, friend, neighbor, community volunteer, and chief baby wrangler.<br><br> Our daughter, Bess, was thirteen months old and terrifyingly mobile. She kept me on my toes by toddling eagerly toward anything that might kill her. Her death wish list included, but was by no means limited to, stairs, stoves, streams, snakes, wasps, and well-sharpened knives.<br><br> The sixth member of our family was Stanley, a sleek black cat with dandelion-yellow eyes. Stanley had a decided preference for Bill, though he was kind enough to tolerate the rest of us. He divided his time between sleeping in Bill's favorite armchair and keeping his long, curling tail out of Bess's reach.<br><br> Bill's father, William Willis, Sr., had made our happiness complete when he'd retired from his position as the head of the family firm and moved to England to be near his grandchildren. A genteel and well-heeled widower, Willis, Sr., had broken many a hopeful heart in Finch when he'd married the noted watercolorist Amelia Bowen. The newlyweds lived just outside of Finch, in Fairworth House, a graceful Georgian mansion surrounded by a modest estate.<br><br> Mrs. Craven lived in Bluebell Cottage, a tiny gem in the necklace of golden-hued stone buildings that encircled the village green. She'd moved into her small cottage a few years after Bill and I had moved into our somewhat larger one, and I'm ashamed to say that I wasn't on hand to greet her when she arrived. I'd been toilet training the twins at the time&#x2014;an exercise guaranteed to concentrate the mind&#x2014;and I'd been too preoccupied with Making Toilet Time Fun to spare a thought for an elderly newcomer.<br><br> I'd spared many thoughts for Mrs. Craven since then. I paused to chat with her whenever our paths crossed, and they crossed almost daily. Like the rest of our neighbors, Mrs. Craven and I took tea breaks in Sally Cook's tearoom; joined in the weekly sing-alongs at Peacock's pub; attended services at St. George's Church; and shopped at Taxman's Emporium, Finch's grandly named general store.<br><br> I could also count on seeing Mrs. Craven at the many villagewide events that kept Finch from becoming too somnolent. Nothing, not even the changeable English weather, could keep her away from the flower show, the art show, the church fete, and the harvest festival, and she always arrived in plenty of time to snag a front-row seat at the Nativity play. She was famous in Finch for using a pair of antique opera glasses to view the annual sheepdog trials and she seemed to take a great deal of pleasure in watching my horse-mad sons and their friends compete for ribbons in the local gymkhana.<br><br> Mrs. Craven had no children of her own and no close relatives. She'd outlived most of her friends and she'd lost her beloved husband to the ravages of Alzheimer's disease. She'd once told me that his lengthy decline and his final passing had prompted her to leave her old village behind and to make a fresh start in a place untainted by painful memories. I'd told her that she'd chosen her new home well.<br><br> Everyone in Finch liked Mrs. Craven. Though she didn't own a car, someone could always be found to take her to Upper Deeping to do her banking, to see her doctor, or to hunt for bargains at the Saturday sales. Sally Cook never tired of swapping recipes with her, Dick Peacock named one of his undrinkable homemade cordials after her, and George Wetherhead, the most bashful man in Finch, was relaxed enough in her presence to meet her gaze when they exchanged pleasantries. Mr. Barlow, who served as our local handyman as well as the church sexton, looked after her cottage free of charge, and James Hobson, a retired schoolteacher and an enthusiastic amateur historian, loved to listen to her stories about "the olden days."<br><br> Mrs. Craven could have spent every minute of every day in what passed for a social whirl in Finch, but she chose to spend much of her time alone in Bluebell Cottage, pursuing her primary passion: making quilts. She'd turned her sunny upstairs front bedroom into a workroom, but it wasn't the only room she'd dedicated to her craft. She'd lined the dining room, the lumber room, the attic, and the back bedroom with shelves built to her specifications by Mr. Barlow to hold row upon row of clear plastic boxes in which she stored what appeared to be a lifetime's accumulation of vintage fabrics.<br><br> Though she kept her best china in a handsome mahogany sideboard in the dining room, she used the equally handsome mahogany table as a work surface. I'd often seen a quilt's three layers&#x2014;backing, batting, and top&#x2014;spread one atop the other on the dining room table, awaiting the next phase in production.<br><br> The dining room table met Mrs. Craven's requirements because she didn't make full-size quilts. She specialized in baby quilts, and her baby quilts were very special indeed. Each was handmade from start to finish, and no two were exactly alike.<br><br> She would have nothing to do with prepackaged polyester quilt kits or with the insipid appliqu�d kittens, puppies, and teddy bears the kits' manufacturers deemed suitable for a nursery. Mrs. Craven used only the softest of cotton fabrics to make brightly colored patchwork quilts in a seemingly limitless array of traditional patterns.<br><br> I knew next to nothing about quilt making, but the names of the patterns delighted me. Pastel kittens, puppies, and teddy bears seemed anemic compared with Old Maid's Ramble, Johnny 'Round the Corner, Victorian Fans, Tumbling Blocks, Pinwheels, and Broken Dishes.<br><br> Mrs. Craven "signed" her quilts by embroidering each one with a tiny black-and-white cow. She'd once told me that the little cows were a tribute to her father, who'd managed a prize-winning herd of Friesians for a local landowner when she was growing up. My sons made a game of finding the cows in her finished quilts when we visited Bluebell Cottage, and quite a few adults played the same game when she displayed her quilts at the church fete.<br><br> Of the many quilts Mrs. Craven created, my favorites were also the rarest. They were what she called her "whole-cloth" quilts. Whole-cloth quilt tops were neither pieced together from scraps nor brightly colored. They were made from a single piece of cream-colored fabric embellished from edge to edge with intricate patterns of meticulous cream-colored embroidery. Celtic knots, entwined hearts, feathers, fans, flowers, leaves, spirals, and shooting stars were but a few of the patterns that found their way into Mrs. Craven's whole-cloth quilts, and while the color palette was undeniably subtle, the needlework was nothing short of extraordinary.<br><br> Grant Tavistock and Charles Bellingham, who ran an art appraisal and restoration business from their home in Finch, classified Mrs. Craven as a genius. They could have introduced her to a dozen museum directors who would have jumped at the chance to exhibit her handiwork, but she was too humble even to consider showing her quilts to a knowledgeable curator.<br><br> Instead, she sold her small masterpieces from a stall at the annual church fete and donated every pound of the proceeds to St. George's. Thanks to her fund-raising efforts, the churchyard had a drainage system that could handle heavy downpours, the south porch had a watertight roof, and the lytch-gate had a new set of wrought-iron hinges.<br><br> Mothers who were lucky enough to own one or more of Mrs. Craven's quilts tended to keep them well away from their infants, for fear of the stains associated with infants. I'd framed the three whole-cloth quilts I'd purchased from her and hung them on a wall in our master bedroom. To me, they were works of art.<br><br> Mrs. Craven couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. She believed that her quilts served a practical purpose and she was a bit disappointed in me for treating them so reverently. She would have been better pleased if I'd allowed my children to chew on them, spit up on them, dribble on them, and anoint them with applesauce, pureed carrots, and other less savory substances. To Mrs. Craven, a well-used quilt was a well-loved quilt.<br><br> On a damp Thursday evening in early April, Bess and I spotted our elderly neighbor as she took a seat in one of the folding chairs Mr. Barlow had set up in the old schoolhouse, which had for many years served as Finch's village hall. The flower show, the art show, and the Nativity play were held there, but the orderly rows of folding chairs signaled the advent of a village affairs committee meeting. By the time Mrs. Craven arrived, nearly everyone who lived in Finch was present.<br><br> Millicent Scroggins, Opal Taylor, Selena Buxton, and Elspeth Binney&#x2014;whom Bill had dubbed "the Handmaidens" because of their devotion to his father&#x2014;sat together in the second row of chairs. I could hear them discussing Sally Cook's new pageboy haircut and whether or not it would suit Christine Peacock. Christine and Sally sat side by side between their respective husbands, making it easy for the Handmaidens to compare neck lengths, brow widths, and cheekbone breadths.<br><br> In the back row, Grant Tavistock and Charles Bellingham were deep in conversation with Horace Malvern, a local dairy farmer who wished to commission a portrait painting of his two-year-old grandson, little Horace Malvern III. James and Felicity Hobson had also chosen chairs in the back row, but though they sat together, they were engaged in separate conversations. While Felicity described the layout of her herb garden to Mr. Barlow, James described his newest piece of metal-detecting equipment to Lilian Bunting, who shared his interest in local history.<br><br> Lilian was married to the vicar of St. George's Church, but her husband hardly ever attended committee meetings. Theodore Bunting had inadvertently inspired the sin of envy in his flock by receiving a special dispensation from our all-powerful chairwoman, Peggy Taxman, to spend committee evenings at home in the vicarage, where he could enjoy a nice cup of cocoa while he worked out the kinks in the sermon he would deliver on Sunday.<br><br> Jasper Taxman and George Wetherhead sat at the long table on the dais that also served as the stage for the Nativity play. Jasper was the committee's treasurer and George was its secretary, but both men were overshadowed by Jasper's formidable wife, Peggy Taxman, who sat regally between them in the chairwoman's chair.<br><br> Bree Pym, a young New Zealander who'd inherited a house near Finch from her great-grandaunts, the late and much lamented Ruth and Louise Pym, arrived only minutes before Peggy called the meeting to order. Bree was temporarily on her own because her boyfriend, the noted conservationist Jack MacBride, was on a lecture tour in Scandinavia.<br><br> Bree Pym stood out in Finch because of her youth, her spiky hair, her tattooed arms, her pierced nostril, her highly original sense of style, and her refusal to be intimidated by Peggy Taxman. Peggy's gimlet gaze and stentorian harrumphs had absolutely no effect on Bree's behavior. If Bess wanted Bree to chase her around the schoolhouse in a game of Big Bad Bear during committee meetings, Bree would chase her, growling menacingly, regardless of the poisonous looks thrown at her from the dais. Bree was the young aunt I would have chosen for Bess, if I'd had a say in the matter.<br><br> Like Bree, Bess and I were temporarily on our own. Easter break was upon us and Bill had decided to put it to good use by taking Will and Rob on a ten-day, boys-only camping trip in the Lake District. To beat the weekend traffic, they'd loaded Bill's car on Wednesday evening and driven off in the wee hours of Thursday morning. I'd waved good-bye to them without the slightest twinge of resentment.<br><br> I was perfectly happy to be excluded from their adventure. The Lake District was the rainiest region in England, and while April wasn't one of its rainiest months, I could almost guarantee that April showers would do what they had to do to bring May flowers. The thought of being cooped up in a wet tent with a toddler who was still in diapers didn't fill me with glee.<br><br> Even a fair-weather camping trip wouldn't have appealed to me. I could too easily envision Bess toddling merrily into campfires, toasting forks, wasps' nests, and patches of poison ivy to regard camping as anything other than a hospital visit waiting to happen. If Bill and the boys had been spending ten days in a country hotel on the shores of Lake Windermere, I would have been green with envy. Since they weren't, I wasn't.<br><br>Mrs. Craven never missed a village affairs committee meeting,and I tried very hard to miss as few as possible. Peggy Taxman, who ran the post office, the general store, the greengrocer&#x2019;s shop, and every committee meeting that had ever been held in Finch, had a nasty habit of &#x201c;volunteering&#x201d; absentees for duties that invariably required the use of a broom and a small fleet of rubbish bins. Needlessto say, her meetings were always well attended.<br><br>Though Mrs. Craven had a spotless attendance record, she contributed nothing to the proceedings. In stark contrast to the rest of the villagers, who could discuss the pros and cons of purchasing a new tea urn for months on end, Mrs. Craven was content to sit in silence while vital decisions were made&#x2014;usually by Peggy Taxman&#x2014; about the harvest festival, the church fete, and the other events that filled the village calendar.<br><br>I suspected that Mrs. Craven&#x2019;s reticence stemmed from her humility. She was willing to share her opinions with me over a cup of tea in her snug little kitchen, but I couldn&#x2019;t convince her to express them to a wider audience. The limelight possessed no allure f...</p><h2>The Best Recipe: Grilling and Barbecue</h2><p>Can you make really good pulled pork at home? Which cut of meat makes the best beef kebabs?

Miraculously provided with food, but with no clues to the meaning of their strange new afterlife, billions of people from every period of Earth's history--and prehistory--must start again.<br><br>Sir Richard Francis Burton would be the first to glimpse the incredible way-station, a link between worlds. This forbidden sight would spur the renowned 19th-century explorer to uncover the truth. Along with a remarkable group of compatriots, including Alice Liddell Hargreaves (the Victorian girl who was the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland), an English-speaking Neanderthal, a WWII Holocaust survivor, and a wise extraterrestrial, Burton sets sail on the magnificent river. His mission: to confront humankind's mysterious benefactors, and learn the true purpose--innocent or evil--of the Riverworld . . .</p><p><i>To Your Scattered Bodies Go</i> is the Hugo Award-winning beginning to the story of Riverworld, Philip Jos� Farmer's unequaled tale about life after death. When famous adventurer Sir Richard Francis Burton dies, the last thing he expects to do is awaken naked on a foreign planet along the shores of a seemingly endless river. But that's where Burton and billions of other humans (plus a few nonhumans) find themselves as the epic Riverworld saga begins. It seems that all of Earthly humanity has been resurrected on the planet, each with an indestructible container that provides three meals a day, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, a lighter, and the odd tube of lipstick. But why? And by whom?<p> That's what Burton and a handful of fellow adventurers are determined to discover as they construct a boat and set out in search of the river's source, thought to be millions of miles away. Although there are many hardships during the journey--including an encounter with the infamous Hermann Goring--Burton's resolve to complete his quest is strengthened by a visit from the Mysterious Stranger, a being who claims to be a renegade within the very group that created the Riverworld. The stranger tells Burton that he must make it to the river's headwaters, along with a dozen others the Stranger has selected, to help stop an evil experiment at the end of which humanity will simply be allowed to die. <i>--Craig E.

Now considered a classic, <i>Creative Visualization</i> teaches readers how to use their imaginations to manifest their deepest desires. In a straight-talking narrative, Gawain uses the first part to cover the basics, with chapters such as "How to Visualize," "Affirmations," and "Creative Visualization Only Works for the Good." Once she shows readers how visualization actually works, Gawain moves on to loftier discussions, such as "Contacting Your Higher Self," "Meeting Your Guide," "Setting Goals," and "Treasure Maps."<p> Fear not; this isn't a spiritual-lightweight book for people with a severe case of the "gimmes." Gawain has her priorities in the right place, and she cautions readers that creative visualization will not serve greed or shallow-minded thinking. For example, she discourages the cycle of trying to have more money, so you can do what you want in life, so you will be happier. "The way it actually works is the reverse," she explains. "You must first be who you really are, then do what you need to do, in order to have what you want."

Every dream, inflection, or slip of tongue in his &#x201c;hysterical&#x201d; patients has meaning and reveals some hidden truth. When a mysterious and beautiful medium dies under extraordinary circumstances, Max&#x2019;s good friend, Detective Oskar Rheinhardt, calls for his expert assistance. The medium&#x2019;s body has been found in a room that can only be locked from the inside. Her body has been shot, but there&#x2019;s no gun and absolutely no trace of a bullet. On a table lies a suicide note, claiming that there is &#x201c;such a thing as forbidden knowledge." All signs point to a supernatural killer, but Liebermann the scientist is not so easily convinced. Set in the Vienna of Freud, Klimt, and Mahler, a time of unprecedented activity in the worlds of philosophy, science, and art, <i>A Death in Vienna</i> is an elegantly written novel, taut with suspense and rich in historical details.</p><p><b>Frank Tallis</b> is a writer and clinical psychologist.

I remember it well because my<br>father&#x2014;Mendel Liebermann&#x2014;had suggested that we meet for<br>coffee at The Imperial. I had a strong suspicion that something<br>was on his mind. . . .<br><br></i>A roiling mass of black cloud had risen from behind the Opera<br>House like a volcanic eruption of sulphurous smoke and ash. Its dimensions<br>suggested impending doom&#x2014;an epic catastrophe on the<br>scale of Pompeii. In the strange amber light, the surrounding buildings<br>had become jaundiced. Perched on the rooftops, the decorative<br>statuary&#x2014;classical figures and triumphal eagles&#x2014;seemed to have<br>been carved from brimstone. A fork of lightning flowed down the<br>mountain of cloud like a river of molten iron. The earth trembled and<br>the air stirred, yet still there was no rain. The coming storm seemed to<br>be saving itself&#x2014;building its reserves of power in preparation for an<br>apocalyptic deluge.<br>The streetcar bell sounded, rousing Liebermann from his reverie<br>and dispersing a group of horse-drawn carriages on the lines.<br>As the streetcar rolled forward, Liebermann wondered why his father<br>had wanted to see him. It wasn&#x2019;t that such a meeting was unusual;<br>they often met for coffee. Rather, it was something about the manner<br>in which the invitation had been issued. Mendel&#x2019;s voice had been curiously<br>strained&#x2014;reedy and equivocal. Moreover, his nonchalance<br>had been unconvincing, suggesting to Liebermann the concealment of<br>an ulterior&#x2014;or perhaps even unconscious&#x2014;motive. But what might<br>that be?<br>The streetcar slowed in the heavy traffic of the Karntner Ring, and<br>Liebermann jumped off before the vehicle had reached its stop. He<br>raised the collar of his astrakhan coat against the wind and hurried<br>toward his destination.<br>Even though lunch had already been served, The Imperial was<br>seething with activity. Waiters, with silver trays held high, were<br>dodging one another between crowded tables, and the air was filled<br>with animated conversation. At the back of the caf�, a pianist was<br>playing a Chopin mazurka. Liebermann wiped the condensation off<br>his spectacles with a handkerchief and hung his coat on the stand.<br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, Herr Doctor.&#x201d;<br>Liebermann recognized the voice and without turning replied,<br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, Bruno. I trust you are well?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am, sir. Very well indeed.&#x201d;<br>When Liebermann turned, the waiter continued. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d like to<br>come this way, sir. Your father is already here.&#x201d;<br>Bruno beckoned, and guided Liebermann through the hectic<br>room. They arrived at a table near the back, where Mendel was concealed<br>behind the densely printed sheets of the <i>Wiener Zeitung.<br></i>&#x201c;Herr Liebermann?&#x201d; said Bruno. Mendel folded his paper. He was<br>a thickset man with a substantial beard and bushy eyebrows. His expression<br>was somewhat severe&#x2014;although softened by a liberal network<br>of laughter lines. The waiter added, &#x201c;Your son.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ahh, Maxim!&#x201d; said the old man. &#x201c;There you are!&#x201d; He sounded a<br>little irritated, as though he had been kept waiting.<br>After a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, Liebermann replied, &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m early,<br>Father.&#x201d;<br>Mendel consulted his pocket watch.<br>&#x201c;So you are. Well, sit down, sit down. Another <i>pharis�er </i>for me<br>and . . . Max?&#x201d; He invited his son to order.<br>&#x201c;A <i>schwarzer, </i>please, Bruno.&#x201d;<br>The waiter executed a modest bow and was gone.<br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; said Mendel. &#x201c;How are you, my boy?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Very well, Father.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking a bit thinner than usual.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Am I?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. Drawn.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you eating properly?&#x201d;<br>Liebermann laughed. &#x201c;Very well, as it happens. And how are you,<br>Father?&#x201d;<br>Mendel grimaced.<br>&#x201c;Ach! Good days and bad days, you know how it is. I&#x2019;m seeing that<br>specialist you recommended, Pintsch. And there is some improvement,<br>I suppose. But my back isn&#x2019;t much better.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that.&#x201d;<br>Mendel dismissed his son&#x2019;s remark with a wave of his hand.<br>&#x201c;Do you want something to eat?&#x201d; Mendel pushed the menu<br>across the table. &#x201c;You look like you need it. I think I&#x2019;ll have the <i>topfenstrudel.</i>&#x201d;<br>Liebermann studied the extensive cakelist: <i>apfeltorte, cremeschnitte,<br>truffeltorte, apfelstrudel. </i>It ran on over several pages.<br>&#x201c;Your mother sends her love,&#x201d; said Mendel, &#x201c;and would like to<br>know when she can expect to see you again.&#x201d; His expression hovered<br>somewhere between sympathy and reprimand.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Father,&#x201d; said Liebermann. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been very busy. Too<br>many patients . . . Tell mother I&#x2019;ll try to see her next week. Friday, perhaps?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then you must come to dinner.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Liebermann, suddenly feeling that he had already committed<br>himself more than he really wanted. &#x201c;Yes. Thank you.&#x201d; He<br>looked down at the menu again: <i>dobostorte, guglhupf, linzertorte. </i>The<br>Chopin mazurka ended on a loud minor chord, and a ripple of<br>applause passed through the caf� audience. Encouraged, the pianist<br>played a glittering arpeggio figure on the upper keys, under which he<br>introduced the melody of a popular waltz. A group of people seated<br>near the window began another round of appreciative clapping.<br>Bruno returned with the coffees and stood to attention with his<br>pencil and notepad.<br>&#x201c;The <i>topfenstrudel,</i>&#x201d; said Mendel.<br>&#x201c;The <i>rehr�cken, </i>please,&#x201d; said Liebermann.<br>Mendel stirred the cream into his <i>pharis�er</i>&#x2014;which came with a<br>tot of rum&#x2014;and immediately started to talk about the family textile<br>business. This was not unusual. Indeed, it had become something of a<br>tradition. Profits had risen, and Mendel was thinking of expanding<br>the enterprise: another factory, or even a shop, perhaps. Now that<br>the meddling bureaucrats had lifted the ban on department stores, he<br>could see a future in retail&#x2014;new opportunities. His old friend Blomberg<br>had already opened a successful department store and had suggested<br>that they might go into partnership. Throughout, Mendel&#x2019;s<br>expression was eager and clearly mindful of his son&#x2019;s reactions.<br>Liebermann understood why his father kept him so well informed.<br>Although he was proud of Liebermann&#x2019;s academic achievements, he<br>still hoped that one day young Max would step into his shoes.<br>Mendel&#x2019;s voice slowed when he noticed his son&#x2019;s hand. The fingers<br>seemed to be following the pianist&#x2019;s melody&#x2014;treating the edge of the<br>table like a keyboard.<br>&#x201c;Are you listening?&#x201d; said Mendel.<br>&#x201c;Yes. Of course I&#x2019;m listening,&#x201d; Liebermann replied. He had become<br>accustomed to such questioning and could no longer be caught<br>out, as was once the case. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re thinking of going into business with<br>Herr Blomberg.&#x201d;<br>Liebermann assumed a characteristic position. His right hand&#x2014;<br>shaped like a gun&#x2014;pressed against his cheek, the index finger resting<br>gently against the right temple. It was a &#x201c;listening&#x201d; position favored by<br>many psychiatrists.<br>&#x201c;So&#x2014;what do you think? A good idea?&#x201d; asked Mendel.<br>&#x201c;Well, if the existing department store is profitable, that sounds<br>reasonable enough.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a considerable investment.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it is.&#x201d;<br>The old man stroked his beard. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t seem to be very keen on<br>the idea.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Father, does it matter what I think?&#x201d;<br>Mendel sighed. &#x201c;No. I suppose not.&#x201d; His disappointment was palpable.<br>Liebermann looked away. He took no joy in disappointing his<br>father and now felt guilty. The old man&#x2019;s motives were entirely<br>laudable, and Liebermann was perfectly aware that his comfortable<br>standard of living was sustained&#x2014;at least in part&#x2014;by Mendel&#x2019;s exemplary<br>management of the family business. Yet he couldn&#x2019;t ever<br>imagine himself running a factory or managing a department store.<br>The idea was ludicrous.<br>As these thoughts were passing through his mind, Liebermann noticed<br>the arrival of a gentleman in his middle years. On entering the<br>caf�, the man removed his hat and surveyed the scene. His hair was<br>combed to the side, creating a deep side parting, and his neatly<br>trimmed mustache and beard were almost entirely gray. He received a<br>warm welcome from the head waiter, who helped him to take his coat<br>off. He was immaculately dressed in pin-striped trousers, a widelapeled<br>jacket, and a &#x201c;showy&#x201d; vest. He must have made a quip, because<br>the head waiter suddenly began laughing. The man seemed in no<br>hurry to find a seat and stood by the door, listening intently to the<br>waiter, who now appeared&#x2014;Liebermann thought&#x2014;to have started<br>to tell a story.<br>Mendel saw that his son had become distracted.<br>&#x201c;Know him, do you?&#x201d;<br>Liebermann turned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Dr. Freud,&#x201d; said Mendel in a flat voice.<br>Liebermann was astonished that his father knew the man&#x2019;s identity.<br>&#x201c;Yes, I do know him. And it&#x2019;s <i>Professor </i>Freud, actually.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Professor Freud, then,&#x201d; said Mendel. &#x201c;But he hasn&#x2019;t been a professor<br>for very long, has he?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A few months,&#x201d; said Liebermann, raising his eyebrows. &#x201c;How did<br>you know that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He comes to the lodge.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What lodge?&#x201d;<br>Mendel scowled. &#x201c;B&#x2019;nai B&#x2019;rith.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh yes, of course.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Although God knows why. I&#x2019;m not sure what sort of a Jew he&#x2019;s<br>supposed to be. He doesn&#x2019;t seem to believe in anything. And as for his<br>ideas . . .&#x201d; Mendel shook his head. &#x201c;He gave us a talk last year.<br>Scandalous. How well do you know him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Quite well. . . . We meet occasionally to discuss his work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What? You think there&#x2019;s something in it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The book he wrote with Breuer on hysteria was excellent, and<br><i>The Interpretation of Dreams </i>is . . . well, a masterpiece. Of course, I don&#x2019;t<br>agree with everything he says. Even so, I&#x2019;ve found his treatment suggestions<br>very useful.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then you must be in a minority.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Undoubtedly. But I am convinced that Professor Freud&#x2019;s system&#x2014;<br>a system that he calls psychoanalysis&#x2014;will become more widely accepted.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not in Vienna.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. One or two of my colleagues, other junior psychiatrists,<br>are very interested in Professor Freud&#x2019;s ideas.&#x201d;<br>Mendel&#x2019;s brow furrowed. &#x201c;Some of the things he said last year<br>were obscene. I pity those in his care.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I would be the first to admit,&#x201d; said Liebermann, &#x201c;that he has become<br>somewhat preoccupied&#x2014;of late&#x2014;with the erotic life of his patients.<br>However, his understanding of the human mind extends well<br>beyond our animal instincts.&#x201d;<br>The professor was still standing by the door with the head waiter.<br>He suddenly burst out laughing and slapped his companion on the<br>back. It was clear that the head waiter had just told him a joke.<br>&#x201c;Dear God,&#x201d; said Mendel under his breath, &#x201c;I hope he doesn&#x2019;t<br>come this way.&#x201d; Then he sighed with relief as Professor Freud was ushered<br>to a table beyond their view. Mendel was about to say something<br>else but stopped when Bruno arrived with the cakes.<br>&#x201c;<i>Topfenstrudel </i>for Herr Liebermann and <i>rehr�cken </i>for Herr Doctor<br>Liebermann. More coffee?&#x201d; Bruno gestured toward Mendel&#x2019;s empty<br>glass.<br>&#x201c;Yes, why not? A <i>m�lange, </i>and another <i>schwarzer </i>for my son.&#x201d;<br>Mendel looked enviously at his son&#x2019;s g�teau, a large glazed chocolate<br>sponge cake shaped like a saddle of deer, filled with apricot jam<br>and studded with almonds. His own order was less arresting, being a<br>simple pastry filled with sweet curd cheese.<br>Liebermann noticed his father&#x2019;s lingering gaze.<br>&#x201c;You should have ordered one too.&#x201d;<br>Mendel shook his head. &#x201c;Pintsch told me I must lose weight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, you won&#x2019;t lose weight eating <i>topfenstrudel.</i>&#x201d;<br>Mendel shrugged and took a mouthful of pastry but stopped chew-<br>ing when a loud thunderclap shook the building. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be a bad<br>one,&#x201d; said Mendel, nodding toward the window. Outside, Vienna had<br>succumbed to a preternatural twilight.<br>&#x201c;Maxim,&#x201d; Mendel continued, &#x201c;I wanted to see you today for a reason.<br>A specific reason.&#x201d;<br><i>At last, </i>thought Liebermann. Finally, he was about to discover the<br>true purpose of their meeting. Liebermann braced himself mentally,<br>still unsure of what to expect.<br>&#x201c;You probably think it&#x2019;s nothing to do with me,&#x201d; Mendel added.<br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d; He stopped abruptly and pushed the severed corner of his<br><i>topfenstrudel </i>around the plate with his fork.<br>&#x201c;What is it, Father?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I was speaking to Herr Weiss the other day and . . .&#x201d; Again his<br>sentence tailed off. &#x201c;Maxim.&#x201d; This time he returned to his task with<br>greater determination. &#x201c;You and Clara seem to be getting along well<br>enough and&#x2014;understandably, I think&#x2014;Herr Weiss is anxious to<br>know of your intentions.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My intentions?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Mendel, looking at his son. &#x201c;Your intentions.&#x201d; He carried<br>on eating his cake.<br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; said Liebermann, somewhat taken aback. Although he had<br>considered many subjects that his father might wish to discuss, his relationship<br>with Clara Weiss had not been one of them. Yet now the<br>omission seemed obvious.<br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; replied Liebermann. &#x201c;What can I say? I like Clara very<br>much.&#x201d;<br>Mendel wiped his mouth with a napkin and leaned forward.<br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And . . .&#x201d; Liebermann looked into his father&#x2019;s censorious eyes.<br>&#x201c;And . . . I suppose that my intention is, in the fullness of time to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>(Now it was his turn to hesitate.)</p><h2>Borderland: A Journey Through The History Of Ukraine</h2><p><i>Borderland</i> tells the story of Ukraine. A thousand years ago it was the center of the first great Slav civilization, Kievan Rus. In 1240, the Mongols invaded from the east, and for the next seven centureies, Ukraine was split between warring neighbors: Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, Austrians, and Tatars. Again and again, borderland turned into battlefield: during the Cossack risings of the seventeenth century, Russia's wars with Sweden in the eighteenth, the Civil War of 1918&#x2013;1920, and under Nazi occupation. Ukraine finally won independence in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Bigger than France and a populous as Britain, it has the potential to become one of the most powerful states in Europe.In this finely written and penetrating book, Anna Reid combines research and her own experiences to chart Ukraine's tragic past. Talking to peasants and politicians, rabbis and racketeers, dissidents and paramilitaries, survivors of Stalin's famine and of Nazi labor camps, she reveals the layers of myth and propaganda that wrap this divided land. From the Polish churches of Lviv to the coal mines of the Russian-speaking Donbass, from the Galician shtetlech to the Tatar shantytowns of Crimea, the book explores Ukraine's struggle to build itself a national identity, and identity that faces up to a bloody past, and embraces all the peoples within its borders.</p><p>Borderland tells the story of Ukraine.

Di Filippo coined &#34;ribofunk&#34; by fusing &#34;ribosome&#34; (as in cellular biology) with &#34;funk&#34; (as in rock and roll). In the world of Ribofunk, biology is a cutting-edge science, where the Protein Police patrol for renegade gene splicers and part-human sea creatures live in Lake Superior, dealing with toxic spills. Ribofunk depicts a sentient river; a sultry bodyguard who happens to be part wolverine; a reluctant thrill seeker who climbs a skyscraper-and finds himself stuck; and a chain-smoking Peter Rabbit who leads his fellows in a bloody rebellion against-whom else?-Mr. McGregor.</p><p>Nebula finalist Paul Di Filippo follows <i>The Steampunk Trilogy</i>, a collection of alternate-history novellas, with <i>Ribofunk</i>, a biotechnological hard-SF collection. As the radical shift of genres may indicate, <i>Ribofunk</i> is astonishingly diverse in subjects and styles, even though its 13 stories make up a future history. Despite the generous number of stories, the book's quality and creativity remain high throughout. In "Brain Wars," a genetically engineered disease afflicts an Antarctic army with enough psychobiological horrors to frighten even the famed neurologist Oliver Sacks. In "The Boot," a 2060s-era private investigator seeks a bio-enhanced thief-gambler who can see the dynamics of chaos and may therefore be able to beat any odds, even those of capture. In "The Bad Splice," the PI finds himself trapped alone in the superseaweed-choked, storm-torn North Atlantic with the diabolical Krazy Kat, a "splice," or genetically engineered animal-man, who has escaped bondage and become a splice-rights terrorist. A few characters recur sporadically, but one appears in every story: the Earth, its biosphere progressively altering with every tale, until the ultimate transformation of the final story, which brings the collection, novel-like, to a tremendous, terrifying, apocalyptic climax.<p> Few SF writers are as imaginative, energetic, or idea rich as Paul Di Filippo, and fewer still have as broad a knowledge of science and culture. And there's no contemporary SF writer who's more fun to read. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Paul DiFillippo is the author of The Steampunk Trilogy, Fractal Paisleys, and Ciphers, and is a two-time Nebula Award finalist.

After Gershon Klein is found dead, Honey and her kids vanish too, further complicating this overrich brew. Scouring the environs of Jerusalem in their search for the missing Yalom boys, turning up bomb plots as they go, Peter and Rina get a fix on the killer and take an inside look at some Israeli institutions. The multitude of plot threads and characters, however, may trip up some readers.

She is a professor of creative writing at the University of California, Riverside, and splits her time between California, USA, and Toronto, Canada."Acclaimed novelist Nalo Hopkinson is well-known for her unique postmodern mythos, often drawing on Caribbean folklore, and placing complex characters smack in the center of worlds whose magic isn't always kind and in which decisions are rarely easy. Her newest novel, Sister Mine, has a lighter edge than some of her previous work; it's an engaging, messy fable about the interconnectedness of even the little things in our lives...This is a book about family, and Sister Mine remains a suitably imperfect and vibrant story of family in all its unfathomable wonders and annoyances, and the power it holds over us - or gives us."&#x2015;<b><i>NPR</i></b><br><br>"She's a powerful writer with an imagination that most of us would kill for. I have read everything she has written and am in awe of her many gifts. And her protagonists are unforgettable - formidable haunted women drawn with an almost unbearable honesty - seriously, who writes sisters like Nalo? Takes courage to be that true."&#x2015;<b><i>Junot Diaz, in the <em>LA Times</em></i></b><br><br>"Hopkinson's most wildly imaginative novel since <em>Brown Girl in the Ring</em>.... and some of her most accomplished prose to date; at one point, she conveys the multivalent perceptions of Makeda through stunning passages of pure synaesthesia."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Locus</em></i></b><br><br>"While the fantastical is ever-present, it's the personal and familial that make Sister Mine engaging and captivating. Self-doubt, interpersonal conflict and the struggle for acceptance are just as powerful as the novel's magical objects. Hopkinson's deeply saturated, poetic language is perfect to relate this story, which is deeply felt."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Globe and Mail</em> (Toronto)</i></b><br><br>"The comingling of the fantastical and the real world in this urban fantasy is seamless and surprisingly credible . . . complex relationships and knotty family ties, all with a tasty supernatural flavor."&#x2015;<b><i><em>School Library Journal</em> blog</i></b><br><br>"Hopkins writes in the tradition of African-American science fiction authors like Samuel R. Delany and Octavia Butler, but her approach is singularly expansive, a mythography of the black diaspora. (There are parallels with fellow Caribbean native Junot Diaz's work, not to mention <em>King Rat</em>, China Mieville's similarly musical urban fantasy.) . . . Hopkinson's prose intermingles the quotidian settings and cosmic mysticism with sly, assured ease."&#x2015;<b><i><em>National Post</em> (Canada)</i></b><br><br>"Hopkinson is extremely talented at crafting complicated protagonists, and Makeda is no exception...Her books always feel like glimpses into worlds that are fully detailed and stand on their own...Another great novel from one of the best fantasy authors working today."&#x2015;<b><i>io9.com</i></b><br><br>"The author of sci-fi classics <em>The Salt Roads</em> (2003) and <em>Brown Girl in the Ring</em> (1998), conjures up another hit with Sister Mine."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Essence Magazine<br></em></i></b><br><br>"As audacious as it is addictive."&#x2015;<b><i>A <em>Toronto Life</em> "Must Read"</i></b><br><br>"Hopkinson has lost none of her gift for salty, Caribbean-Canadian talk...and the relationship between Makeda and Abby always rings true: resentment and anger enduringly intertwined with love and loyalty."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></i></b></p><h2>Fundamentals of Celestial Mechanics</h2><p>Has been sitting on the bookshelf pages is starting to yellow no damage</p><p></p><h2>Infographic Guide to Literature (Infographic Guides)</h2><p>Fascinating, insightful, clever and stunning, these infographic diagrams&#34; &#34;will&#34; &#34;help you see literature in a whole new light.</p><p>Joanna Eliot has a BA Hons in Literature and a Masters Degree in Modernism in English Literature.

Novelist Charles Baxter&#39;s essays on contemporary fiction dissect the connections between life, values, and art with unerring and insightful precision. Baxter compares the dysfunction in contemporary fiction to the removal of the villain from politics. He decries the prostituting of epiphany as a commercial product that turns fiction into a pseudo-instruction manual, and he reveals the magic within Donald Barthelme&#39;s innovative prose, created with a generosity &#34;almost unseen&#34; in American letters. This is a powerful companion to Baxter&#39;s short story collections.<p><b>Charles Baxter</b> is the author of ten books, including <i>The Feast of Love</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award, and <i>The Art of Subtext: Beyond Plot</i>.

In <i>The Ordeal of the Reunion</i>, Mark Wahlgren Summers goes beyond this vitally important question, focusing on Reconstruction's need to form an enduring Union without sacrificing the framework of federalism and republican democracy. Assessing the era nationally, Summers emphasizes the variety of conservative strains that confined the scope of change, highlights the war's impact and its aftermath, and brings the West and foreign policy into an integrated narrative. In sum, this book offers a fresh explanation for Reconstruction's demise and a case for its essential successes as well as its great failures.

Henry Short Story Award.The Bay of Noon <br> CHAPTER ONE A military plane crashed that winter on Mount Vesuvius. The plane had taken off from Naples in fog; some hours afterwards it was reported missing. The search went on for hundreds of miles around - over the Ionian Sea, and at Catania, at Catanzaro. Two days later, when the fog lifted, we could see the wreck quite clearly, crumbled against the snow-streaked cone of the volcano, overlooking the airfield from which it had set out. No one had thought of looking close to home. Since that time, so they say, we have developed better methods of keeping in touch. For it is twelve or fifteen years, now, since the accident took place. When I was a child I used to be filled with envy when adults recalled events of twelve or fifteen years before. I would think it must be marvellous, to issue those proclamations of experience - 'It was at least ten years ago', or 'I hadn't seen him for twenty years'. But chronological prestige is tenacious: once attained, it can't be shed; it increases moment by moment, day by day, pressing its honours on you until you are lavishly, overly endowed with them. Until you literally sink under them. A centenarian has told me that memory protects one from this burden of experience. Whole segments of time droppedout, she said: 'Of five or six years, say, around the turn of the century, all I can remember is the dress that someone wore, or the colour of a curtain.' And I would be pleased, rather than otherwise, at the prospect of remembering Naples in similar terms - a lilac dress Gioconda wore one morning driving to Caserta, or the Siena-coloured curtains of the apartment in San Biagio dei Librai. But memory, at an interval of only fifteen years, is less economical and less poetic, still clouded with effects and what seemed to be their causes. The search is still under way in unlikely places - too assiduous, too attenuated; too far from home. There was then, there is still, a big NATO establishment at Naples organized around the United States Sixth Fleet, with token components from other countries. When I was brought there from London to translate documents from Italian into English and to do some clerical sifting and sorting of coloured papers, there were already a number of English girls at the base doing similar things - Angelas and Hilarys and Rosemarys who had wanted to get away from Reading or Ruislip or Holland Park. For the most part those fugitive girls were in their twenties; and over them hung an immanence, a pale expectancy, as if their youth were yet to come to them. What passion they possessed for change had, in getting them to Naples, expended itself; once there, they relapsed into their natural obligingness. Breathlessly polite, they made among the drab or primary colours of military life their tender, uncherished strokes of pastel. My work, though much like theirs, took place in a different building; my life, while no more nourishing, had been lived on a different continent. I had spent the war out of England. Although I was a child when that took place, there was always an implication to it, if not of defection at least of something regrettable. Even my brother used to say, 'Jenny spent the war in Africa,' in a way that at once apologized for and excluded me. I arrived at Naples in autumn, a belatedly inserted item on the budget of a joint mission to study docking and airport facilities with a view to extending them. With a view to extending them, for no such mission ever pronounced the existing state of affairs to be adequate. The airfield - the same airfield that lay to the south, at the foot of the volcano, far from our offices - was to be, for example, enlarged to receive jet planes, which were coming into military use then. In addition, there were rockets, there were higher and higher explosives, there was the prospect of the nuclear submarine. Even in London where over translations of preliminary papers I learnt the terms I had never in either language known, it seemed implausible that such responsibilities should have devolved on Naples. Ignorant of the Mediterranean, hesitantly speaking an Italian sporadically acquired in Somaliland, I prepared to take the city's part with the loyalty of the native-born. Our offices were part of a modern complex at Bagnoli, on the northern outskirts of Naples. Modern, I say, but the buildings now have dated in a remarkable way: it is their characterlessness that identifies them, and their resolute unawareness of place. In and around those buildings thousands of NATO personnel and their families lived out their term of exile, requiring nothing of Italy or its language, passing among themselves stale, trumpery talismans of home, recreating a former existence from the shelves of the PX until such time as they should - on other, equally alien shores - speak with nostalgia and authority of the Bay of Naples. Having arrived with the advance segment of the mission, I was installed along with them - by one of those errors that are the mark of the highly organized - into a hotel in Naples itself, one of the good hotels on the seafront. It was error, then, that set me apart from the first. In the early weeks, when a car fetched us from the hotel before it was light and brought us home each evening after dark, when orders obliged us to idleweek-ends away in our empty office, we did not live in Naples so much as merely sleep in it. Yet I waited for the city, and its intervention, much in the way that those pale companions of mine awaited life itself. &nbsp; <br> In the fourth week I was lent - was detailed, as they said, for military precision runs to many syllables - for the day to a British civilian. A marine biologist having letters from Whitehall, he too needed pages translated while he waited for the Naples Aquarium to take him under what my Colonel repeatedly and delightedly called its wing. In the office next to ours a telephone was put down, a name was called. The name was out, sick with a virus; for it, mine was substituted. The following morning I did not take the car - the Vehicle, as the Colonel called it - in the dark to Bagnoli, but walked in winter sunshine the few steps from the Hotel Vesuvio to the Hotel Royal, and sent up my name through the concierge. Of the morning I remember little: sitting with a pad and pencil in a glassed-in, blue-rugged hotel room - a room that was not, with its aquatic reflections, unlike an aquarium in itself - turning my eyes time and again to the bay; seeing it, because of what I was writing about, not as a blue surface filling a curve of land but as a dense and teeming jungle in which weeds and rocks and wrecks and a million creatures reproduced in strange counter-part the city of Naples itself. Echinoderms, I wrote of, and the Mysidae and the Squillidae, and compiled a list of publications on the Mollusca - these unknowns appearing more familiar in kind than did the accustomed daily litanies of troops and mat�riel; just as my companion, civil and aloof, seemed more compatible than the sullen hearties of the base. The work went quickly; it was not yet noon when my scientist gave up his silent assembling of the papers that were divided into rows across his bed, and said, 'You have caught me up.' With a wad of completed pages in my hand, I rose - to show willing, a sort of coming to attention. He took the finished sheets and put them in a folder without checking them - a courtesy, I thought, like not seeming to count one's change. 'Can you go and play for a while? I have to put the next lot together, and something is missing. Could you be back here, say, at three?' In this way I was set at liberty, and left the hotel as full of joyful purpose as if I had been going to an assignation. Until then I had not been once in the city in the middle of the day. But after weeks of surveillance the sense of freedom came as much from the fact that no one knew where I was, as from walking the seafront of Naples before noon on a fine December morning. The three hours at my disposal - a space of time that now, when all days are my own, often passes unnoticed - seemed then a gift, a luxury beyond which one need not forecast. I did not doubt that I would turn up again at the Hotel Royal at three. The only thing to be thought of was how to spend these hours of one's own. I possessed a single introduction to Naples - one letter provided by a London acquaintance who had encouraged me to present myself at the address on the envelope. 'Somewhere in the thick of Naples,' said this wellwisher, who had never himself been there. The address was that of a woman whose name had become known - and was by then becoming forgotten - in connection with one of the post-war films from Italy. There was <i>Bicycle Thieves</i>, you remember; there was <i>Shoeshine</i>, there was Open City. And then there was a film called <i>Del Tempo Felice</i> that was made from an obscure little book, a sort of prose poem; and it was the author of this book whose name was on my envelope. I had never read it, her book. I had seen her film, but I was then very young and had remembered its darkly photographed interiors and flickering close - ups for two reasons - because itwas the first time I had been to a film that used sub - titles; and the first time that I saw the lines of Dante from which the title was taken and which appeared, off-centre, on the screen along with the other credits, duly translated in sub-title but carrying, as sometimes happens, in their own, then unfamiliar, language the physical aspect of poetry that sends a shiver across the sight and skin. And now that there was time to call myself to her attention, I could only think: a woman of this kind, with work, friends, admirers - a public, even - would hardly welcome a stranger with no better credentials than a note (a note which I had seen for myself began 'Dear Signorina') from a remote acquaintance at Ealing Studios. The name - her Christian name, that is - had struck me; also the address, for there was a street number, then simply 'San Biagio dei Librai': Saint Biagio of the Booksellers. I had remarked on this address when the letter was handed to me. And the friend at Ealing - who had known the lady, it now came out, only outside Italy - said, 'Let's hope I got it right. I rather gather this is the good old family palazzo. I hope she'll do you proud.' All had, in fact, been in the realm of aspiration or surmise. It occurred to me, as I walked back to the Hotel Vesuvio, that I might telephone this Signorina at once and see if she would have me. But the prospect of picking up the telephone and shattering her unsuspecting morning was more than I could face for her; and when I got up to my room I took out, instead of her address, a guidebook that had lain one month in the bureau drawer. 'The traveller who would know Naples,' - so the guidebook dictated, open on the hotel counterpane - 'must take himself to Spaccan�poli, the split of Naples, the street that traversed the city's nucleus in classical times, and is now called San Biagio dei Librai.' Nevertheless it took some time to make the call. First I got cut off, and in the wire a low voice asked, though not of me, <i>'Tu, come giudichi?'</i> Then I heard the telephone ringing, ringing, and was about to hang up at the instant when the ringing exchanged itself for a voice. Tracing the hotel's stitched monogram with a nervous finger, I made myself known; and in English the voice cried, 'Good. Good that you called. Yes, come, come. Come now. Come for lunch. Are you coming in a taxi? - my street is up, you can't enter, it's the drains. Tell him to let you out at the Ges� Nuovo, the church. Then ask the way, it's only a few minutes on foot from there.' &nbsp; <br> Below the Ges� Nuovo there is a ramp of a street that rises to a corner where Degas once lived with his Neapolitan relatives. The ascent, oblique, suggests the piazza above by giving, as if through a door ajar on a high landing, a glimpse of the exorbitant, gem - cut fa�ade of a church, with to the left a flash of red stucco, to the right an ornate obelisk, before it catapults you on to a scene that appears, from this method of approaching it, more bizarre than ever. Had I been accompanied, I might have laughed out loud at the profligacy of imagination expended there; but solitude, which is held to be a cause of eccentricity, in fact imposes excessive normality, at least in public, and I crossed the piazza with no outward sign of interest and placed myself against the faceted stones of the church. From there one looked, then, across at the bombed shell of Santa Chiara, half-reconstructed, and at a derelict campanile on the one hand and a massive palace on the other; and this I did for some moments, only showing it was new to me by inquiring, of the priest who came to close the church, the way to San Biagio dei Librai. The day had deteriorated, it was winter again, and the piazza was abandoned for the siesta. One pre-war Fiat, as lonely, as historic as the single car on an antiquated postcard, had beenparked in the middle of the square. And I, perhaps, walking away from the church door, would have something now of the same anonymous arrested look - captured, as the saying goes, in the picture; serving to show, merely, by human contrast, the dimensions of buildings, to date the photograph unwittingly with my clothes and hair; somebody purloined from a crowd to act as an example. The light itself had dwindled to the joyless sepia of an old photograph. The picture is re-animated - rather, it dissolves to life - and I enter a passageway of a street, the narrow channel that flows out from the farther side of the square. Past a hundred shops and stalls that sold, as they are selling still, song records, coloured nylon sponges, the gauze and sugar paraphernalia of christenings and first communions, plastic Bambis, bolts of print material, gold jewellery and silver representations of arms and legs to be offered up to departmental saints; past open sacks of coffee beans, stacks of books new and seventh-hand, and barrows piled with handtools - through this I came, that afternoon, into San Biagio dei Librai. What could be closed was closing in a savage drum - roll of descending grilles; what could be wheeled was being trundled away. Over cobbled blocks - that were posted here and there with stone bollards intended to keep out the cars that expertly slid between them and rushed on to straddle a long trench of drainage repairs - I walked by palaces of stone and stucco, rusticated or red, white with grey facings, brown, orange, rose or ochre, no two alike, facing each other across the street's corridor as monumentally as if they had been rising, isolated, in some open place that did their proportions justice. On the flanks of those palaces, smaller buildings had been grafted in every age except our own - in any unlikely opening, or any precarious ledge, apparently with the sole provision that they bear no resemblance to one another. Forgotten or overlaid, antiquity had been buried in the walls, making its laconicsignal - a sunken column, Greek, dark, smooth as silk, with acanthus capital; a Roman inscription, traces of a fortification, or crenellations that, centuries since, had been surmounted by a rooftop. In one vast courtyard was planted a colossal sculpture, Roman or Renaissance, of a horse's head; another ended in galleries of disintegrating frescoes. It was a deep square of a building, hers; pale stucco divided into a dozen apartments, or a hundred. The <i>portiere,</i> coming out from his lunch with his fork, spooled with pasta, in his hand, directed me to the <i>pian' nobile</i>, taking me into the courtyard to point out, in a fold of that flaking parchment, the inner staircase I should take. There were several flights of deep stone steps, u...</p><h2>Death on the Nile</h2><p>Agatha Christie&#39;s most exotic murder mystery, reissued with a striking new cover designed to appeal to the latest generation of Agatha Christie fans and book lovers.

Penguin Lost finds Viktor Zolotaryov sneaking back into Kiev under an assumed identity to undertake a dangerous mission: He wants to find Misha, his penguin, whom he fears has fallen into the hands of the criminal mob looking for Viktor himself. Guilt-ridden and determined to do what it takes, Viktor falls in with a Mafia boss who employs him in an election-rigging campaign, in return for introducing Viktor to other mobsters who can help him find Misha. And as Viktor goes from mobster to mobster, trying to survive in Kiev&#39;s criminal underground, the evidence mounts that Misha may be someplace even worse: the zoo of a Chechen warlord. What ensues is for Viktor both a quest and an odyssey of atonement, and for the reader, a stirring mix of the comic and the tragic, the heartbreaking and the inspiring. In the widely hailed prequel to Penguin Lost, Death and the Penguin, aspiring writer Viktor Zolotaryov leads a down-and-out life in poverty-and-violence-wracked Kiev-he&#39;s out of work and his only friend is a penguin, Misha, that he rescued when the local zoo started getting rid of animals. Even more nerve-wracking: a local mobster has taken a shine to Misha and wants to keep borrowing him for events. But Viktor thinks he&#39;s finally caught a break when he lands a well-paying job at the Kiev newspaper writing &#34;living obituaries&#34; of local dignitaries-articles to be filed for use when the time comes. The only thing is, it seems the time always comes as soon as Viktor writes the article. Slowly understanding that his own life may be in jeopardy, Viktor also realizes that the only thing that might be keeping him alive is his penguin.</p><p></p><h2>Ghost Patrol: A History of the Long Range Desert Group, 1940 - 1945</h2><p>The origins of most of the west&#x2019;s Special Forces can be traced back to the Long Range Desert Group which operated across the limitless expanses of the Libyan Desert, an area the size of India, during the whole of the Desert War from 1940 &#x2013; 1943. After the defeat of the Axis in North Africa they adapted to serve in the Mediterranean, the Greek islands, Albania, Yugoslavia and Greece. They became the stuff of legend. The brainchild of Ralph Bagnold, a prewar desert explorer, featured, in fictional terms in The English Patient, who put all of his expertise into the creation of a new and, by the standards of the day, highly unorthodox unit. Conventional tactical thinking shunned the deep heart of the vast desert as it was thought to be a different planet, a harsh, inhospitable wilderness where British forces could not possibly survive even less operate effectively. Bagnold, Pat Clayton and Bill Kennedy Shaw created a whole new type of warfare.<br><br>Using specially adapted vehicles and the techniques they&#x2019;d learned in the&#x2018;30s, recruiting only men of the right temperament and high levels of fitness and endurance, the first patrols set out bristling with automatic weapons. The 30-cwt Chevy truck and the famous Jeep have become iconic, the LRDG, in a dark hour, was the force which took the fight to the enemy, roving over the deep desert &#x2013; a small raider&#x2019;s paradise, attacking enemy convoys and outposts, destroying aircraft and supplies, forcing the Axis to expend more and more resources protecting their vulnerable lines. <br><br>Their work was often dangerous, always taxing, exhausting and uncomfortable. They were a new breed of soldier. The Axis never managed to equip any similar unit, they never escaped their fear of the scorching wilderness. Once the desert war was won they transferred their skills to the Mediterranean sector, re-training as mountain guerrillas, serving in the ill-fated Dodecanese campaign, then in strife torn Albania, Yugoslavia and Greece, fighting alongside the mercurial partisans at a time the Balkans were sliding towards communist domination or civil war.<br><br>In addition LRDG worked alongside the fledgling SAS and they established, beyond all doubt, the value of highly trained Special Forces, a legacy which resonates today.<br><br><b>Table of Contents</b><br><br>Acknowledgements <br>Maps<br>Chronology <br>Dramatis Personae<br>Being Introductory<br><br>1 Legends of the &#x2018;Blue&#x2019;<br>2 Piracy on the High Desert, 1940<br>3 The Year of Dangerous Living, 1941<br>4 &#x2018;The Libyan Taxi Company Limited&#x2019;, 1941&#x2013;1942<br>5 Sting of the Scorpion, 1942<br>6 Out of Africa, 1942&#x2013;1943<br>7 The Wine-Dark Sea, 1943<br>8 Garlic-Reeking Bandits, 1944&#x2013;1945<br>9 On the shores of the Adriatic, 1944&#x2013;1945<br>10 Ghost Patrols, 1945&#x2013;2015<br><br>Glossary <br><br>Appendices<br>Appendix 1: Weapons, Vehicles, Training &amp; Equipment<br>Appendix 2: LRDG Commanders and Patrol Designations<br>Appendix 3: Patrol Commanders<br>Appendix 4: Daily LRDG Ration Scale<br>Appendix 5: LRDG Roll of Honour<br>Appendix 6: A View from the Other Side &#x2013; Axis Units<br>Appendix 7: Ultra in the Desert War<br><br>Bibliography<br>Index<br></p><p>John Sadler&#39;s main specialism is in military history, as an accomplished author, lecturer, battlefield tour guide, heritage professional and historical interpreter.

He opens with a chapter that sets the stage, sketching in the origins of the British presence in Egypt, the challenges the desert presents to military activity, and a glimpse at earlier campaigns in the region. He then reviews the origins of British special operations forces in the Middle East. Thereafter we get three chapters on the LRDG in the desert war in 1940-1942, then three more on its role in Italy and the Balkans in 1943-1945, where it was less effective. Sadler seasons his account with appropriate historical asides and profiles of many people, most of them on the eccentric side, as well as with digressions on logistics, equipment, and more. He concludes with an overview of special operations since the end of World War II. His many appendices deal with such matters as equipment, rations, and even Italian and German special operations forces in the desert war. This is a good, and probably the best, read for anyone interested in these special operations."

By presenting the range of styles vying for attention at a single point in time, the authors of <i>1900: Art at the Crossroads</i> challenge the idea of art as a linear progression. The book is the lavish catalog of an exhibition organized by the Royal Academy of London and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Its schizophrenic theme is suggested in the title of the first essay, "Art in 1900: Twilight or Dawn?" The material is organized into concepts established by the French Academy two centuries earlier--still life, the nude, landscapes, and history paintings--plus sections with more modern relevance such as cityscapes and bathers. Arranging works by theme rather than by artist or movement allows for some brilliant juxtapositions: a classical naked Danae by Carolus-Duran is paired with an abstracted Degas nude; a sentimental study of crippled boys by Bastida with a vicious Munch mother-and-child (both paintings titled <i>Inheritance</i>). The preoccupations of fin-de-si�cle society emerge; several different treatments of Salome with the severed head of John the Baptist, for example, embody male fears of the femme fatale and her threat to bourgeois values. The book ends with a useful 70-page section of artist biographies. <i>1900</i> is a beautifully produced and stimulating study of a pivotal point in European art history. <i>--John Stevenson</i>An exhibition organized by The Royal Academy of Arts, London, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, 1900: Art at the Crossroads examines the diverse range of artworks produced during this period. While artists such as C?zanne, Degas, Rodin, and Klimt were well known by the turn of the century, lesser-known artists were making art that equally reflected the stylistic and social concerns of this epoch. In his essay, the Guggenheim's Rosenblum explores various related themes that are woven within the paintings and sculpture. These include subjects such as fantasy vs. reality, the representation of women, and the new psychological probity. The Royal Academy's Stevens shows how the Exposition Universelle of 1900 in Paris and the issue of nationalism as well as the genesis of international styles in the art of this period foreshadowed developments and the rest of the 20th century. The catalog portion of this book is illustrated with color plates of all the works in the exhibition and divided by theme, such as the city, landscape, portraits, bathers and nudes, and religion. This handsome volume is recommended for general art collections as well as academic and art libraries.<br><i>-Sandra Rothenberg, Framingham State Coll., MA </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dale Chihuly: A Celebration</h2><p><p>Dale Chihuly, the hugely popular artist who works in glass, celebrates his 70th birthday in 2011.

This is nonfiction at its very best.&#x201d;&#x2014;Lee Child</b><br><br>The true story of two doomed ships and a daring search-and-rescue operation that shines a light on the elite Coast Guard swimmers trained for the most dangerous ocean missions</b><br><br> In late September 2015, Hurricane Joaquin swept past the Bahamas and swallowed a pair of cargo vessels in its destructive path: <i>El Faro</i>, a 790-foot American behemoth with a crew of thirty-three, and the <i>Minouche</i>, a 230-foot freighter with a dozen sailors aboard. From the parallel stories of these ships and their final journeys, Tristram Korten weaves a remarkable tale of two veteran sea captains from very different worlds, the harrowing ordeals of their desperate crews, and the Coast Guard&#x2019;s extraordinary battle against a storm that defied prediction.<br><br> When the Coast Guard received word from Captain Renelo Gelera that the <i>Minouche </i>was taking on water on the night of October 1, the servicemen on duty helicoptered through Joaquin to the sinking ship. Rescue swimmer Ben Cournia dropped into the sea&#x2014;in the middle of a raging tropical cyclone, in the dark&#x2014;and churned through the monstrous swells, loading survivors into a rescue basket dangling from the helicopter as its pilot struggled against the tempest. With pulsating narrative skill in the tradition of Sebastian Junger and Jon Krakauer, Korten recounts the heroic efforts by Cournia and his fellow guardsmen to haul the <i>Minouche&#x2019;</i>s crew to safety.<br><br> Tragically, things would not go as well for Captain Michael Davidson and <i>El Faro</i>. Despite exhaustive searching by her would-be rescuers, the loss of the vessel became the largest U.S. maritime disaster in decades. As Korten narrates the ships&#x2019; fates, with insights drawn from insider access to crew members, Coast Guard teams, and their families, he delivers a moving and propulsive story of men in peril, the international brotherhood of mariners, and the breathtaking power of nature.<br><b><br>Praise for <i>Into the Storm<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;The story [Tristram] Korten tells is&nbsp;impressively multifaceted, exploring everything from timely issues such as climate change to timeless themes such as man&#x2019;s struggle against the ocean&#x2019;s fury.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Miami New Times</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;<i>Into the Storm</i> is a triumph of reporting and you-are-there writing that becomes a deeper tale&#x2014;with more implications about our own lives&#x2014;with every chapter.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Robert Kurson, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of<i> Shadow Divers</i></b></p><p><b>Tristram Korten</b> is a magazine, newspaper, and radio journalist.

The predawn sky above was dark, but not still. It never is. Currents of air continued journeys that had started continents away, where they twisted and flowed across mountains and deserts, then forests and oceans, pulled and pushed by troughs and ridges of low and high pressure, deflected and guided across an in�visible topography, propelled by the sun&#x2019;s heat and the planet&#x2019;s motion. Cool air descended while warm air rose. Within the �currents, celestial gases drifted through a transparent skyscape of peaks and valleys&#x2014;�nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ozone, and water vapor&#x2014;�redistributed according to their weight up to the stratosphere. The moisture formed into clouds&#x2014;�cirrus, altocumulus, cumulus, stratocumulus, the towering and formidable cumulonimbus&#x2014;�that dissolve and re-�form. Below this invisible ballet, in the emergent morning of September 17, 2015, the plane waited on a runway at the U.S. Coast Guard&#x2019;s Air Station Clearwater, on Florida&#x2019;s west coast. Nearly twenty thousand horsepower spread over four turbo�prop engines, waiting to ride up and surf those clouds.<br><br>Across town, Ben Cournia woke in the blue-�black of early morning to a quietly chirping alarm. He hit the button quickly and eased his long body up, careful not to disturb his wife, Lindsay, as she slept next to him. She&#x2019;d have to get up in a couple of hours and go through the tumult of getting the kids to school by herself&#x2014;�making their lunches, packing their backpacks, and hustling them along through teeth brushing and getting dressed. Lord knows, she needed her rest.<br><br>Cournia quietly made his way to the bathroom and bent his tall frame over the sink as he turned on the water, his skin pale in the bathroom light, his long arms ropey with muscles and veins. He had thick brown hair, cut short per regulations, and his eyes were set back under a prominent brow. Cournia&#x2019;s swimsuit hung from the shower curtain rod, still damp from the swim in the pool last night. This is their tradition. The night before Daddy leaves for his two-�week deployments, the kids get an after-�dinner swim in the pool.<br><br>As Lindsay cleared the table, Lucy, six, and Lincoln, three, had run squealing to their rooms and wiggled into their suits. Ben also changed into his, then went out and knelt by the pool&#x2019;s edge, furrowing his brow, pretending to fix something. The kids came running out, the soft pads of uncalloused little feet thup-�thupping over to him, and&#x2014;�splash!&#x2014;�they pushed Daddy into the pool. Oh no, he&#x2019;s drowning! Daddy needs help! The kids jumped in for the rescue. They glided under the water like chubby little dolphins. His kids can swim, Ben has made sure of that. Of course, they rescued Daddy. Afterward, they showered and got ready for bed. Ben tucked them in.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll be gone for a little bit, he told them each.<br><br>How long, Daddy? Lucy asked.<br><br>About two weeks.<br><br>Are you going to save people?<br><br>Yes.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>Lucy and Lincoln were learning the rules and rhythms of a Coast Guard family: A parent sometimes has to go away to help others. Their father is a U.S. Coast Guard aviation survival technician, otherwise known as a rescue swimmer. His job is to save people in the worst conditions possible. There aren&#x2019;t many reasons good and clear enough for a child to accept a parent&#x2019;s absence, but rescuing people in danger is one of them.<br><br>In the dark of the morning, Cournia packed his toothbrush. He changed into his one-�piece green flight suit, freshly washed the night before, and headed down to the kitchen. He brewed a cup of coffee, which he needed to shake the last vapors of sleep from his brain before he started packing the cooler. He didn&#x2019;t want to forget anything, anything. He slid the cooler over to the fridge and opened the freezer door. First to go in were the packages of frozen vegetables: green beans, scalloped potatoes, and broccoli, as well as cookie dough to make chocolate chip cookies in his hooch on his off days. Then he opened the refrigerator door to load perishables: chicken breasts, sirloin steaks, pork tenderloins, sliced cheeses and deli meats for sandwiches. Lots of fruit: oranges, bananas, berries. Cournia makes his living off his body, and he is acutely aware of what fuel is needed for it to work at peak efficiency. The calories in his diet should break down as follows: 40 percent carbohydrates, 40 percent proteins, 20 percent fats. To achieve that goal, every meal during his two-�week stint is planned out with military precision. He closed the cooler, latched it, and carried it out to the car.<br><br>This house, four bedrooms with the backyard pool on a quiet cul-�de-�sac, is the couple&#x2019;s first home. Cournia&#x2019;s last posting was on a snow-�covered island in Alaska, where the family lived on base. But there&#x2019;s no base housing in Clearwater, so they scrimped and saved, and now they have their piece of normalcy, their piece of peace. Cournia loaded the cooler and his duffel bag into his Ford Taurus, slid into the seat, and started the engine. He steered south toward Air Station Clearwater, the house in the rearview mirror slipping into the darkness behind him.<br><br>Versions of this ritual were playing out across Clearwater and neighboring Tampa. At flight mechanic Joshua Andrews&#x2019;s home, his wife, Marleen, got up to make coffee while Josh, unflappably friendly with prominent ears and an easy smile, started packing his cooler. Josh is from Texas and takes his grilling seriously. He had marinated his meats the day before, sealed them in plastic bags, and put them in the freezer. He had also bought enough food for an extra week or two. Marleen typically questioned this. Honey, are you sure you need all that? He always gave the same reply: Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. If something went wrong, a plane broke down or a big storm came, not unheard of this time of year, and they were stuck on deployment longer than usual, he wanted to be ready.<br><br>They, too, had let the kids, Ashton, nine, and Leah, five, stay up later than usual to spend extra time with Dad. They&#x2019;d all piled onto the couch and watched The Flash, the superhero show on the CW. When Josh put Leah to bed, she asked why he had to go. In case somebody needs my help, he told her. Unlike the Cournia kids, she never accepted this answer and didn&#x2019;t this time, either, judging by the frown on her face, which meant she would probably spend most of the nights while he was gone in bed with Mom.<br><br>The kids insisted on saying goodbye in the morning, despite the early hour, so after Josh had packed his bags and dragged them to the door, Marleen went to rouse Ashton and Leah. Even the three dogs got in on the act, swarming the doorway. Cody, the oldest, positioned himself by the threshold, ready to make a mad dash for the truck. Then the kids, groggy, emerged. Ashton hugged Dad, who reminded his son to behave, listen to his mother, and watch out for his little sister. He bent down and scooped up Leah, still warm from bed, nuzzled her round cheek, and reluctantly put her down. She snuck behind him and slipped a picture of a heart she had drawn into one of his bags. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss you, Daddy,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d written.<br><br>The Post family had a unique situation: Both Rick and Rachel were Coast Guard helicopter pilots. They had a daughter who was about to turn one, so when one of them was deployed, the other was left behind with their infant and a full-�time job. Support from friends and their church helped, people who could look after the baby, but it was tough. Rick and Rachel liked to joke that the real tour of duty was staying home. At least on deployment they could get a solid night&#x2019;s sleep.<br><br>This morning it was Rick&#x2019;s turn to ship out. His first alarm went off before 5:00 a.m. The couple were such heavy sleepers they used three alarms. The goal was to get up before the big alarm, the third and final one with the metal bells, started clanging in the bathroom, forcing someone to get out of bed and shut it off. Rick made it just in time. He was a thin twenty-�eight-�year-�old, with an angular face, narrow eyes, and a sharp nose that gave him an avian appearance, which was appropriate for a pilot. Rick looked like he never stopped concentrating.<br><br>After he had thrown his gear bag and food in their big Suburban he went back upstairs to change into his flight suit. Rachel was just starting to wake up. He kissed her goodbye, then went to get one last look at the baby, grateful he&#x2019;d be back in time for her first birthday.<br><br>At the air station the guardsmen parked in the long-�term lot adjacent to the tarmac, where the C-�130, officially the HC-�130H Hercules, was being readied for flight. The plane was gleaming white, with the Coast Guard&#x2019;s signature safety-�orange sash painted right behind the cockpit, overlaid by the service&#x2019;s coat of arms, a stars-�and-�stripes shield on top of two crossed anchors. The tail was also orange, with a single star emblazoned on it. Before each flight, the hulking aircraft gets not just a full working over to assess all systems but a thorough washing and cleaning. Any mud on the flaps, any chipped paint on the wings, would be an unacceptable symbol of shoddiness.<br><br>The aging workhorse of the Coast Guard&#x2019;s air fleet, the Herc is 99 feet long and 38 feet high with a 132-�foot wingspan. It can fly 2,500 miles before needing to refuel. The plane is not fast, and it&#x2019;s not sleek, but it can land on a rutted field, launch with only 800 feet of runway, and haul anything anywhere. Hercs have been used to drop bombs, transport troops, and catch satellites. In sixty years of service it&#x2019;s been a flying ambulance, midflight refueler, hurricane hunter, fire tanker, and search and rescue platform. It is tough and versatile, which is exactly how the Coast Guard sees itself.<br><br>By far the smallest of the country&#x2019;s military services, the Coast Guard has about 40,000 members, not including reserves. The next smallest is the Marines, with about 190,000. The Navy has 315,000, followed by the Air Force with 330,000, and that great lumbering behemoth, the Army, with 487,000.<br><br>Yet the Coast Guard is busy whether we are at war or not. Not only does it rescue people in distress at sea as well as during floods and other natural disasters, it is also tasked with securing all ports; enforcing maritime laws; patrolling our coasts and �waterways; protecting underwater marine resources; patrolling against illegal fishing; inspecting commercial and recreational vessels; and a host of other law enforcement jobs. Because its numbers are so small, the service can&#x2019;t afford to have its personnel specialized too narrowly. In the Coast Guard, everyone juggles several duties. On an air station such as Clearwater, the base commander, communications officers, and office workers are all expected to fly patrols.<br><br>The Hercules requires a crew of seven and has a cavernous interior, with rows of parallel roller tracks running the length of the fuselage floor. This design allows it to be quickly converted from a cargo plane to a troop transport. Special pallets that lock into the rollers allow up to fifty-�one thousand pounds of cargo, such as supplies and vehicles, to be loaded onto the rear ramp and slid inside. (The width of the fuselage was determined by drawing a circle around an M551 Sheridan tank.) On rescue missions, life rafts and dewatering pumps can be rolled into the plane and dropped on or near struggling ships. During the rush to contain a tanker gushing oil into the sea, the Herc can carry dispersants to help control the spill. Then, just as easily, it can be transformed into a passenger plane by swapping out the cargo pallets for pallets with seats bolted onto them. The seats get rolled up into the belly of the plane just like the life rafts would, and in no time you&#x2019;ve got seating for ninety-�two.<br><br>On this day, the Herc&#x2019;s duties were split between passengers and cargo. In the hour or so before they were scheduled to take off, Ben Cournia and the others lugged their gear bags and coolers to the rear of the plane and tossed them onto a pallet. Then they headed to the mess hall to get some breakfast. After he ate, as he walked back to the plane, Cournia pulled out his cellphone and texted Lindsay. She&#x2019;d be up by now.<br><br>Stuff is loaded, he wrote. Getting ready to leave. See you in a couple of weeks.<br><br>OK, she shot back. Be safe.<br><br>No problem there, he thought to himself. In the five years he&#x2019;d been going on these deployments, he&#x2019;d never once had to worry about being safe.</p><h2>The New Encyclopedia of Daylilies: More Than 1700 Outstanding Selections</h2><p><p>It's no exaggeration to say that daylilies are the premier flowering perennial.

She employs unusual perspectives, rich colors, and wonderful textures as the ball goes to sea through a storm and a night to another sunny, empty beach where a little boy finds it and rapturously carries it home. The brilliant light on the final beach and the tenderly portrayed mother and child who joyously find the ball are almost worth the whole book. Unfortunately, the simple text creates a jarring effect and the resulting story line seems arbitrary. Somehow the movement and pace is off, and readers' emotions are not engaged. The young people who lose the ball look like adults on one page and children on the next. The concepts used don't quite fit. For example, "catch" and "throw" don't match the gestures they caption. The panel captioned "above" suggests a picture of the sun as much as a ball. The placement of the ball in subsequent pictures creates a sense of dislocation rather than coherent movement. This simple picture book could be seen as a story of a carelessly treated toy finding a loving home, but the beautiful pictures call for poetry, not abrupt phrases. An unsuccessful work by Bang is better than many picture books on the market, but she has set a fine standard, and this effort falls short. Large collections will want it for the high calibre of the art. --Marilyn Iarusso, New York Pub .

In an age when crops can be imported all year round, we tend to forget just how important this time was to our ancestors&#x2015;the failure of the harvest meant starvation and death. Early August was a time to celebrate the fruits of the first harvest and work positive magic for prosperity and protection. <br> <br>Explore the origins, customs, and lore of Lughnasa and learn about similar festivals around the world, including Celtic, Norse, Roman, Egyptian, Russian, English, and Native American celebrations. <i>Lammas</i> includes a host of ideas for celebrating the bounty of the earth: <br> <br>� Prepare mouth-watering recipes for seasonal food, wine, and incense <br>� Perform Lughnasa spells, songs, games, and rituals, including a traditional Witch &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ritual never before published <br>� Make traditional crafts including corn dollies, sacred masks, totem shields, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more <br> <br>Compared to well-known Celtic holidays such as May Day (Beltane) and Halloween (Samhain), few people are familiar with the lore of Lughnasa. Even modern Wiccan books rarely devote more than a few pages to the Lammas celebration. Whether you're just starting on the path or are an experienced Witch looking for a new perspective on this ancient festival, you'll find that <i>Lammas</i> is a cornucopia of history, folklore, recipes, spells, and rituals. <br> <br>Lughnasa survived the rise of Christianity by becoming Lammas (from the Anglo-Saxon <i>hlaef-mass</i>, meaning loaf-mass). Lammas marks the first harvest when the first grain is gathered, ground, and baked into a bread known as the Lammas loaf, a practice still popular in many parts of the British Isles. The following spells excerpted from <i>Lammas </i>offer ways for the modern kitchen witch to make magic. <br> <br><b>LAMMAS BREAD WISH SPELL <br></b>Make a loaf of bread at Lammas and before you put the loaf into the oven, dip a paintbrush in milk and write on the crust what you most desire. Bake the bread, then eat it while still warm.<br><b>LAMMAS BREAD PROTECTION SPELL <br></b>A book of Anglo-Saxon charms advised the crumbling of the Lammas loaf into four pieces and the burying of them in the four corners of the barn to make it safe for all the grain that would be stored there. You can use this old spellcraft in a protection spell for your home. <br> <br>Bake a Lammas loaf, and when it is cool break it into four pieces&#x2015;don't cut it with a knife&#x2015;and take one to each corner of your property with the words: <br> <br><i></i><i>I call on the spirits <br>Of north, and south, east and west <br>Protect this place <br>Now, at the time of the Blessing. <br> <br></i>Leave the bread for the birds to eat or bury the pieces. <br> <br></p><p><p>Anna Franklin (England) has been a witch for 30 years, and a Pagan in her heart for all her life.

While a certain degree of whimsy, fancy, and wish-fulfillment play a part in their teachings on divination from ashes, color symbolism, and the like, the authors write engagingly. This book should give pleasure and welcome advice to those interested in pre- and extra-Christian ritual practice.

Does it happen when you're ten years old and someone gives you a Polaroid camera for Christmas? Maybe it begins in college, when you're finally on your own to discover the world as <i>you</i> see it for the first time.</p><p>Looking at the life of legendary photographer Cindy Sherman, Jan Greenberg and Sandra Jordan have created an unconventional biography, that much like Cindy Sherman's famous photographs, has something a little more meaningful under the surface. Infusing the narrative with Sherman's photographs, as well as children's first impressions of the photographs, this is a biography that goes beyond birth, middle age, and later life. It's a look at how we look at art.</p></p><p><b>Jan Greenberg </b>and<b> Sandra Jordan</b> are the authors of many distinguished books about art, including<i> Action Jackson</i> (a Sibert Honor book), <i>Ballet for Martha</i>: <i>Making Appalachian Spring</i> which earned five starred reviews, a Sibert Honor, and the NCTE Orbis Pictus Award for Outstanding Nonfiction for Children, and <i>The Mad Potter </i>which was a Sibert Honor book. They also have received the 2013 Children's Book Guild of Washington D.C. Award for their body of work. Ms. Greenberg lives in St. Louis, Missouri. Ms. Jordan lives in New York, New York.Gr 4&#x2013;8&#x2014;The duo's latest collaboration centers on a contemporary artist so enigmatic that it's no surprise the authors begin by asking readers, "Who is Cindy Sherman?" The work opens with Sherman's childhood and early career in New York City before launching into chapters organized around milestone projects/installations (Chapter 4 covers Rear Screen Projections 1980&#x2013;1981, Fairy Tales 1985, and more). Sherman's iconic photos are reproduced with clarity and quality, with most laid out over a page or half page. The authors break down the myriad personas present in the artist's body of work and challenge students to consider the relationship between interpretation and meaning and how much weight to give to an artist's intent (or lack of) when viewing and analyzing art. Egalitarian statements such as "Art is for everyone at every age" lend the book a welcoming tone, and the authors often address readers directly ("Do clothes and hairstyles make us what we are?") and include quotes from real kids that oftentimes demonstrate the subjective nature of art interpretation.

Arranged chronologically by theatre of war and campaign, this book offers a complete organizational breakdown of the units on all the fronts, including the Eastern and Italian Fronts. Each campaign includes a compact history of the role and impact of aircraft on the course of the conflict, as well as orders of battle, lists of commanders and campaign aces such as Manfred von Richtofen, Eddie Rickenbacker, Albert Ball and many more. Every type of aircraft is featured, including the numerous variations and types of well- known models, such as the Fokker Dr.I, the Sopwith Camel and the SPAD SVII, through to lesser-known aircraft, such as the Rumpler C.1, and the Amstrong Whitworth FK8. Each aircraft profile is accompanied by exhaustive specifications, as well as details of individual and unit markings. Packed with more than 200 color profiles of every major type of combat aircraft from the era, <i>Aircraft of World War I 1914&#x2013;1918</i> is an essential reference guide for modellers, military historians and aircraft enthusiasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Jack Herris is a former US Navy aviator with a degree in aeronautical engineering.

He is the author of several books including <i>Pfalz Aircraft WWI</i> and <i>SPAD Two-Seaters of WWI</i>."Part of this publisher&#x2019;s The Essential Aircraft Identification Guide series this is a handy book, especially at the introductory level. Books that are small&#x2014;in size and hence, ideally, as here, in price&#x2014;are the hardest to get right because every word has to count and everything they declare worthy of inclusion has to be justifiable. On that score the reader is in exceedingly competent hands because both authors are known quantities in the WWI aviation world. In fact, Herris, a former Navy aviator, has since gone on to start his own publishing house that in its few years of existence has built an extraordinarily strong catalog of titles.... an excellent stepping stone into a complex and interesting subject that has been neglected for very long."

She later reported that she had seen visions of Christ and the souls in purgatory as a child, as well as a circular core with three sections representing the Trinity.

But a real cowboy is hard to find these days, even in the West," says the narrator in the title story of Pam Houston's critically acclaimed collection. In these strong, shrewd, and very funny stories, we meet smart women who are looking for the love of a good man, and men who are wild and hard to pin down. Our heroines are part daredevil, part philosopher, all acute observers of the nuances of modern romance. They go where their cowboys go, they meet cowboys who don't look the part -- and they have staunch friends who give them advice when the going gets rough. <i>Cowboys Are My Weakness</i> is a refreshing and realistic look at men and women -- together and apart.</p><p>Pam Houston was born in New Jersey and graduated from Denison University in 1983. Her collection of stories, <i>Cowboys Are My Weakness,</i> was the 1993 winner of the Western States Book Award, and now appears in eight languages. "How to Talk to a Hunter" was selected for <i>Best American Short Stories 1990.</i> Houston is the editor of the anthology <i>Women on Hunting</i> and wrote the text for a book of photographs called <i>Men Before Ten A.M.</i> She has been a contributing editor at <i>Elle</i> and <i>Ski,</i> now writes regularly for <i>Cond� Nast Sports for Women,</i> and teaches creative writing at workshops across the country. Formerly a hunting guide and river guide, she lives at 9,000 feet near the Continental Divide in southwestern Colorado.<p> <b>"How to Talk to a Hunter"</b> </p><p> When he says "Skins or blankets?" it will take you a moment to realize that he's asking which you want to sleep under. And in your hesitation he'll decide that he wants to see your skin wrapped in the big black moose hide. He carried it, he'll say, soaking wet and heavier than a dead man, across the tundra for two -- was it hours or days or weeks? But the payoff, now, will be to see it fall across one of your white breasts. It's December, and your skin is never really warm, so you will pull the bulk of it around you and pose for him, pose for his camera, without having to narrate this moose's death. </p><p> You will spend every night in this man's bed without asking yourself why he listens to top-forty country. Why he donated money to the Republican Party. Why he won't play back his messages while you are in the room. You are there so often the messages pile up. Once you noticed the bright green counter reading as high as fifteen. </p><p> He will have lured you here out of a careful independence that you spent months cultivating; though it will finally be winter, the dwindling daylight and the threat of Christmas, that makes you give in. Spending nights with this man means suffering the long face of your sheepdog, who likes to sleep on your bed, who worries when you don't come home. But the hunter's house is so much warmer than yours, and he'll give you a key, and just like a woman, you'll think that means something. It will snow hard for thirteen straight days. Then it will really get cold. When it is sixty below there will be no wind and no clouds, just still air and cold sunshine. The sun on the windows will lure you out of bed, but he'll pull you back under. The next two hours he'll devote to your body. With his hands, with his tongue, he'll express what will seem to you like the most eternal of loves. Like the house key, this is just another kind of lie. Even in bed; especially in bed, you and he cannot speak the same language. The machine will answer the incoming calls. From under an ocean of passion and hide and hair you'll hear a woman's muffled voice between the beeps. </p><p> <br> Your best female friend will say, "So what did you think? That a man who sleeps under a dead moose is capable of commitment?" </p><p> <br> This is what you learned in college: A man desires the satisfaction of his desire; a woman desires the condition of desiring. </p><p> The hunter will talk about spring in Hawaii, summer in Alaska. The man who says he was always better at math will form the sentences so carefully it will be impossible to tell if you are included in these plans. When he asks you if you would like to open a small guest ranch way out in the country, understand that this is a rhetorical question. Label these conversations future perfect, but don't expect the present to catch up with them. Spring is an inconceivable distance from the December days that just keep getting shorter and gray. </p><p> He'll ask you if you've ever shot anything, if you'd like to, if you ever thought about teaching your dog to retrieve. Your dog will like him too much, will drop the stick at his feet every time, will roll over and let the hunter scratch his belly. </p><p> <br> One day he'll leave you sleeping to go split wood or get the mail and his phone will ring again. You'll sit very still while a woman who calls herself something like Janie Coyote leaves a message on his machine: She's leaving work, she'll say, and the last thing she wanted to hear was the sound of his beautiful voice. Maybe she'll talk only in rhyme. Maybe the counter will change to sixteen. You'll look a question at the mule deer on the wall, and the dark spots on either side of his mouth will tell you he shares more with this hunter than you ever will. One night, drunk, the hunter told you he was sorry for taking that deer, that every now and then there's an animal that isn't meant to be taken, and he should have known that deer was one. </p><p> <br> Your best male friend will say, "No one who needs to call herself Janie Coyote can hold a candle to you, but why not let him sleep alone a few nights, just to make sure?" </p><p> <br> The hunter will fill your freezer with elk burger, venison sausage, organic potatoes, fresh pecans. He'll tell you to wear your seat belt, to dress warmly, to drive safely. He'll say you are always on his mind, that you're the best thing that's ever happened to him, that you make him glad that he's a man. </p><p> Tell him it don't come easy, tell him freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose. </p><p> <br> These are the things you'll know without asking: The coyote woman wears her hair in braids. She uses words like "howdy." She's man enough to shoot a deer. </p><p> <br> A week before Christmas you'll rent <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> and watch it together, curled on your couch, faces touching. Then you'll bring up the word "monogamy." He'll tell you how badly he was hurt by your predecessor. He'll tell you he couldn't be happier spending every night with you. He'll say there's just a few questions he doesn't have the answers for. He'll say he's just scared and confused. Of course this isn't exactly what he means. Tell him you understand. Tell him you are scared too. Tell him to take all the time he needs. Know that you could never shoot an animal; and be glad of it. </p><p> <br> Your best female friend will say, "You didn't tell him you loved him, did you?" Don't even tell her the truth. If you do you'll have to tell her that he said this: "I feel exactly the same way." </p><p> <br> Your best male friend will say, "Didn't you know what would happen when you said the word 'commitment'?" </p><p> But that isn't the word that you said. </p><p> He'll say, "Commitment, monogamy, it all means just one thing." </p><p> <br> The coyote woman will come from Montana with the heavier snows. The hunter will call you on the day of the solstice to say he has a friend in town and can't see you. He'll leave you hanging your Christmas lights; he'll give new meaning to the phrase "longest night of the year." The man who has said he's not so good with words will manage to say eight things about his friend without using a gender-determining pronoun. Get out of the house quickly. Call the most understanding person you know who will let you sleep in his bed. </p><p> <br> Your best female friend will say, "So what did you think? That he was capable of living outside his gender?" </p><p> <br> When you get home in the morning there's a candy tin on your pillow. Santa, obese and grotesque, fondles two small children on the lid. The card will say something like "From your not-so-secret admirer." Open it. Examine each carefully made truffle. Feed them, one at a time, to the dog. Call the hunter's machine. Tell him you don't speak chocolate. </p><p> <br> Your best female friend will say, "At this point, what is it about him that you could possibly find appealing?" </p><p> Your best male friend will say, "Can't you understand that this is a good sign? Can't you understand that this proves how deep he's in with you?" Hug your best male friend. Give him the truffles the dog wouldn't eat. </p><p> <br> Of course the weather will cooperate with the coyote woman. The highways will close, she will stay another night. He'll tell her he's going to work so he can come and see you. </p><p> He'll even leave her your number and write "Me at Work" on the yellow pad of paper by his phone. Although you shouldn't, you'll have to be there. It will be you and your nauseous dog and your half-trimmed tree all waiting for him like a series of questions. </p><p> <br> This is what you learned in graduate school: In every assumption is contained the possibility of its opposite. </p><p> <br> In your kitchen he'll hug you like you might both die there. Sniff him for coyote. Don't hug him back. </p><p> He will say whatever he needs to to win. He'll say it's just an old friend. He'll say the visit was all the friend's idea. He'll say the night away from you has given him time to think about how much you mean to him. Realize that nothing short of sleeping alone will ever make him realize how much you mean to him. He'll say that if you can just be a little patient, some good will come out of this for the two of you after all. He still won't use a gender-specific pronoun. </p><p> Put your head in your hands. Think about what it means to be patient. Think about the beautiful, smart, strong, clever woman you thought he saw when he looked at you. Pull on your hair. Rock your body back and forth. Don't cry. </p><p> He'll say that after holding you it doesn't feel right holding anyone else. For "holding," substitute "fucking." Then take it as a compliment. </p><p> He will get frustrated and rise to leave. He may or may not be bluffing. Stall for time. Ask a question he can't immediately answer. Tell him you want to make love on the floor. When he tells you your body is beautiful say, "I feel exactly the same way." Don't, under any circumstances, stand in front of the door. </p><p> Your best female friend will say, "They lie to us, they cheat on us, and we love them more for it." She'll say, "It's our fault; we raise them to be like that." </p><p> Tell her it can't be your fault. You've never raised anything but dogs. </p><p> <br> The hunter will say it's late and he has to go home to sleep. He'll emphasize the last word in the sentence. Give him one kiss that he'll remember while he's fucking the coyote woman. Give him one kiss that ought to make him cry if he's capable of it, but don't notice when he does. Tell him to have a good night. </p><p> <br> Your best male friend will say, "We all do it. We can't help it. We're self-destructive. It's the old bad-boy routine. You have a male dog, don't you?" </p><p> <br> The next day the sun will be out and the coyote woman will leave. Think about how easy it must be for a coyote woman and a man who listens to top-forty country. The coyote woman would never use a word like "monogamy"; the coyote woman will stay gentle on his mind. </p><p> <br> If you can, let him sleep alone for at least one night. If you can't, invite him over to finish trimming your Christmas tree. When he asks how you are, tell him you think its a good idea to keep your sense of humor during the holidays. </p><p> Plan to be breezy and aloof and full of interesting anecdotes about all the other men you've ever known. Plan to be hotter than ever before in bed, and a little cold out of it. Remember that necessity is the mother of invention. Be flexible. </p><p> First, he will find the faulty bulb that's been keeping all the others from lighting. He will explain, in great detail, the most elementary electrical principles. You will take turns placing the ornaments you and other men, he and other women, have spent years carefully choosing. Under the circumstances, try to let this be a comforting thought. </p><p> He will thin the clusters of tinsel you put on the tree. He'll say something ambiguous like "Next year you should string popcorn and cranberries." Finally, his arm will stretch just high enough to place the angel on the top of the tree. </p><p> <br> Your best female friend will say, "Why can't you ever fall in love with a man who will be your friend?" </p><p> Your best male friend will say, "You ought to know this by now: Men always cheat on the best women." </p><p> <br> This is what you learned in the pop psychology book: Love means letting go of fear. </p><p> <br> Play Willie Nelson's "Pretty Paper." He'll ask you to dance, and before you can answer he'll be spinning you around your wood stove, he'll be humming in your ear. Before the song ends he'll be taking off your clothes, setting you lightly under the tree, hovering above you with tinsel in his hair. Through the spread of the branches the all-white lights you insisted on will shudder and blur, outlining the ornaments he brought: a pheasant, a snow goose, a deer. </p><p> The record will end. Above the crackle of the wood stove and the rasp of the hunter's breathing you'll hear one long low howl break the quiet of the frozen night: your dog, chained and lonely and cold. You'll wonder if he knows enough to stay in his doghouse. You'll wonder if he knows that the nights are getting shorter now. </p><p> </p><p>Copyright � 1992 by Pam Houston </p></p><h2>In Tune: Finding How Good Life Can Be</h2><p>The popular singer and his wife recall the overwhelming problems sudden success brought them and how their renewed Christian faith changed their lives</p><p></p><h2>The Meriden Britannia Silver-Plate Treasury, The Complete Catalog of 1886-87 with 3,200 Illustrations (Antiques Series)</h2><p>Excellent reference for late 19th century American Silver &amp; Silverplate</p><p></p><h2>Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-first Century</h2><p><p><strong>NPR Great Read of 2016</strong></p><p>From the acclaimed author of <em>Rip It Up</em> <em>and Start Again</em> and <em>Retromania</em>&#x2014;&#x201c;the foremost popular music critic of this era (<em>Times Literary Supplement</em>)&#x2014;comes the definitive cultural history of glam and glitter rock, celebrating its outlandish fashion and outrageous stars, including David Bowie and Alice Cooper, and tracking its vibrant legacy in contemporary pop.</p><p>Spearheaded by David Bowie, Alice Cooper, T.

Heinlein, about a Lunar colony&#39;s revolt against rule from Earth. The novel expresses and discusses libertarian ideals. It is respected for its credible presentation of a comprehensively imagined future human society on both the Earth and the moon.</p><p>Tom Clancy has said of Robert A. Heinlein, &#34;We proceed down the path marked by his ideas. He shows us where the future is.&#34; Nowhere is this more true than in Heinlein&#39;s gripping tale of revolution on the moon in 2076, where &#34;Loonies&#34; are kept poor and oppressed by an Earth-based Authority that turns huge profits at their expense. A small band of dissidents, including a one-armed computer jock, a radical young woman, a past-his-prime academic and a nearly omnipotent computer named Mike, ignite the fires of revolution despite the near certainty of failure and death.Winner of the 1967 Hugo award, this novel marked Heinlein's partial return to his best form. He draws many historical parallels with the War of Independence, and clearly shows his own libertarian political views.<p>In what is considered one of his most hair-raising, thought-provoking and outrageous adventures, the master of modern SF tells the strange story of an even stranger world -- 21st century Luna, a harsh penal colony where a revolt is plotted between a bashful computer and a ragtag collection of maverick humans. A revolt that goes beautifully until the inevitable happens. But the problem with the inevitable is that it always happens.</p></p><h2>The Pyrates</h2><p>Dashing young Captain Avery is entrusted with the mission of transporting the fabulous Madagascar Crown from London, through treacherous waters infested with dastardly pirates, to Madagascar</p><p>Hollywood meets the bounding main in this Technicolor pantomime by the creator of Flashman, a gloriously silly swashbuckling saga full of buccaneers, tall ships, desert islands, and heaving seas and bosoms. It&#x2019;s all there, right down to a Dead Man&#x2019;s Chest, cleavages that are everything they should be, and characters in sea&#x2013;boots who say nothing but &#x2018;Arr!&#x2019; and &#x2018;Me hearty!&#x2019; in a plot that is wonderfully absurd. Originally published in 1983.The Pyrates is George MacDonald Fraser's tongue-in-cheek homage to the swashbucklers of yore. In these rollicking pages you'll find tall ships and desert islands; impossibly gallant adventurers and glamorous heroines; devilishly sinister cads and ghastly dungeons; improbably acrobatic duels and hair's-breadth escapes; and more plot twists than you can shake a rapier at. A deliriously entertaining combination of high-seas action-adventure and comic hi-jinx.<br></p><h2>Demon Box</h2><p>Exploring the author&#39;s experiences of foreign excursions, family, farm, and society, this collection of nonfictional works features the title essay on the energy of madness</p><p><b>Ken Kesey</b> was born in 1935 and grew up in Oregon. He graduated from the University of Oregon and later studied at Stanford with Wallace Stegner, Malcolm Cowley, Richard Scowcroft, and Frank O' Connor. <b>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</b>, his first novel, was published in 1962. His second novel, <b>Sometimes a Great Notion</b>, followed in 1964. His other books include <b>Kesey's Garage Sale</b>, <b>Demon Box</b>, <b>Caverns</b> (with O. U. Levon), <b>The Further Inquiry</b>, <b>Sailor Song</b>, and <b>Last Go Round</b> (with Ken Babbs). His two children's books are <b>Little Tricker the Squirrel Meets Big Double the Bear</b> and <b>The Sea Lion</b>. Ken Kesey died on November 10, 2001.The central theme running through this collection of stories (many of which seem to be primarily nonfiction with elements of fiction thrown in) by the author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the struggle to come to terms with the legacy of the 1960s. Kesey draws largely on his own experiences after returning to his Oregon farm following a brief stint in prison on drug charges. A series of tales, apparently sections from a novel in progress, star an alter-ego named Devlin Deboree: his relatively tranquil post-jail farm existence is disturbed both by memories of now-dead companions and the seemingly extinct passions of the '60s, and by burned-out refugees from that era who intermittently arrive on his doorstep, hoping for some sort of help from the most famous survivor of the psychedelic wars. Pieces on visiting Egypt and covering a Chinese marathon examine the complex relationship between Americans and people from other cultures. Kesey's distinctive gift with language and tough sense of humor unify this somewhat disorganized collection, and his elegy for the passing of the mad energy of the '60s will strike a responsive chord with all those who lived through those dangerous, liberating years. 30,000 first printing; BOMC and QPBC alternates. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Moscow Sleepers: A Liz Carlyle Novel (Liz Carlyle Novels)</h2><p><p><b>For fans of <i>Homeland </i>and <i>The Night Manager</i>, the latest thriller in Stella Rimington's bestselling espionage series sees Liz Carlyle investigating a sinister Russian plot.</b></p><p>A Russian immigrant lies dying in a hospice in upstate Vermont.

Mordechai Gichon is a military historian and has held major academic positions at Tel Aviv University.Battles Of The Bible presents a comprehensive survey of the wars of ancient Israel. The Bible's military accounts (told in vivid detail) cover a vast period, from the invasion of Canaan by the Israelites under Joshua's command, through the conquest of the kingdom by David and Solomon, and the split of the kingdom into Judah and Israel, to the Maccabees' successful rebellion against Seleucid domination. The reliability of these accounts is supported by their technical accuracy and by descriptions of topographic conditions peculiar to specific battlefields. They bear comparison with military campaigns well after the biblical era, and provide strategic and tactical lessons of value even today. Battles Of The Bible is a fascinating and valuable work, not only for its exacting scrutiny of biblical accounts, but also for its insight into their wider and continuing relevance. Battles Of The Bible is an importance contribution to Old Testament studies, biblical archaeology, and military history. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Total Refusal / Refus Global (Exile Classics series)</h2><p><p>Inspired by the distinguished painter Paul-�mile Borduas, this collective manifesto serves as an invaluable introduction to the major figures of the Canadian avant-garde scene in the 1970s.

Sally was Stephen&#39;s inspiration for his books.PreS-Gr. 2. The irrepressible canine star of three previous adventures (trips to the beach, farm, and mountains) now faces a dreaded trip to the vet. The brief text, narrated in black lab Sally's voice, relates how she fell over a tree stump and hurt herself while chasing her friend Bingo the cat. Her x-ray shows no broken bones, so Sally is allowed to go home and take her medicine. It's the oversize woodcut prints in Huneck's signature folk-art style that make the book memorable. In the clever pictures, humans are represented only by hands and feet and an occasional torso (no faces), and close-ups, such as one showing a tongue depressor approaching Sally's open mouth, allow kids to look right over the vet's shoulder, making Sally's experience more immediate. Burnt orange and yellow backgrounds (and an orange-colored Bingo) contrast nicely with Sally's black shape, which is speckled with fine white lines that give the illusion of hairs. It's an attractively designed tribute to vets that both dog lovers and Sally's fans will like. <i>Julie Cummins</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She builds her novel with characters collected through time&#x2014;from an early pilgrim trapped in an unhappy marriage, to Alan Turing writing letters to a friend&#x2019;s mother, to a 2040 Silicon Valley prodigy incarcerated for designing a &#x201c;babybot&#x201d; with illegal levels of artificial intelligence&#x2014;and by doing so she draws out the shrinking gap that separates us (for now) from our rapidly encroaching technology, as well as the gaps that have always existed between us. This is a sensitive, beautiful, and timely novel that measures our very human need to speak against our possibly more vital need to be heard.

But her story of overcoming didn't start--or end--there. While her white schoolmates were planning their senior prom, Melba was facing the business end of a double-barreled shotgun, being threatened with lynching by rope-carrying tormentors, and learning how to outrun white supremacists who were ready to kill her rather than sit beside her in a classroom. Only her faith in God sustained her during her darkest days and helped her become a civil rights warrior, an NBC television news reporter, a magazine writer, a professor, a wife, and a mother.<br><br>In <i>I Will Not Fear</i>, Beals takes readers on an unforgettable journey through terror, oppression, and persecution, highlighting the kind of faith needed to survive in a world full of heartbreak and anger. She shows how the deep faith we develop during our most difficult moments is the kind of faith that can change our families, our communities, and even the world. Encouraging and inspiring, Beals's story offers readers hope that faith is the solution to the pervasive hopelessness of our current culture.</p><p>"When young people face situations that threaten to rob them of their confidence in themselves and in humanity in general, the result can be devastating for a lifetime. However, Melba Pattillo Beals's book <i>I Will Not Fear</i> quite powerfully presents the lessons in Christian faith that the author learned as a teen faced with fear, humiliation, and outright violence as she helped integrate the Little Rock, Arkansas, public schools. Melba traces how the sound, godly wisdom instilled by her grandmother helped her overcome the adversities of being among the Little Rock Nine and served as a lifetime reminder that God is indeed 'as close as your skin.' Her story encourages selflessness and a persistent confidence that God can and will work things out for his children, in his timing--whether it is reconciliation among people of different ethnicities or feeling helpless when your child is in imminent danger. It is a must-read for teens, their parents, grandparents, and everyone else! I highly recommend it!"<br><br>--<b>Dr. John M.

The Constitution grants each American the right to self-determination, to be protected from others whose actions are destructive to their lives and property. Yet as Kibbe persuasively shows, the political and corporate establishment consolidates its power by infringing upon our independence&#x2014;from taxes to regulations to spying&#x2014;ultimately eroding the ideals, codified in law, that have made the United States unique in history.</p><p>Kibbe offers a surefire plan for reclaiming our inalienable rights and regaining control of our lives, grounded in six simple rules:</p><ol> <li> <strong>&nbsp;Don&#x2019;t hurt people: </strong>Free people just want to be left alone, not hassled or harmed by someone else with an agenda or designs over their life and property.</li> <li> <strong>Don&#x2019;t take people&#x2019;s stuff: </strong>America&#x2019;s founders fought to ensure property rights and our individual right to the fruits of our labors.</li> <li> <strong>Take responsibility: </strong>Liberty takes responsibility. Don&#x2019;t sit around waiting for someone else to solve your problems.</li> <li> <strong>Work for it: </strong>For every action there is an equal reaction. Work hard and you&#x2019;ll be rewarded.</li> <li> <strong>Mind your own business: </strong>Free people live and let live.</li> <li> <strong>Fight the power: </strong>Thanks to the Internet and the decentralization of knowledge, there are more opportunities than ever to take a stand against corrupt authority.</li></ol></p><p><p>Do you believe in the freedom of individuals to determine their own future and solve problems cooperatively?</p><p>Don't hurt people, and don't take their stuff. Simple and straightforward, that's liberty in a nutshell&#x2014;no assembly required.</p><p>And yet it seems like, more and more, the decisions Washington makes about what to do for us, or to us, or even against us, are having an increasingly adverse impact on our lives. Young people can't find jobs, millions of Americans are losing the health care plans they were promised they could keep, and every one of us is somehow being targeted, monitored, snooped on, conscripted, induced, taxed, subsidized, regulated, or otherwise manipulated by someone else's agenda, based on someone else's decisions made in some secret meeting or closed-door legislative deal.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>Our government is out of control. But setting things right again requires that you step up and take your freedom back.</p><p>From Matt Kibbe, the influential leader of FreedomWorks, <em>Don't Hurt People and Don't Take Their Stuff</em> is the first true manifesto of a new libertarian grassroots movement. As political powermongers and crony corporatists in Washington continue to consolidate their control and infringe on our most fundamental liberties, Kibbe makes the libertarian case for freer people, more voluntary cooperation, and solving problems from the bottom up. He calls out the tyranny of faceless bureaucrats with too much power and discretion, laying out a clear road map for restoring liberty. A witty yet piercing critique of government's expanding control over you and your future, <em>Don't Hurt People and Don't Take Their Stuff</em> is a vital read for all those who cherish personal liberty and the unalienable right to choose your own path in life.</p><p>Matt Kibbe is the president and CEO of FreedomWorks, a national grassroots organization that serves citizens in their fight for more individual freedom and less government control. An economist by training, Kibbe is a well-respected policy expert, bestselling author, and a regular guest on CNN, Fox News, The Blaze TV, and MSNBC. He also serves as Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Austrian Economic Center in Vienna, Austria. Kibbe is author of the national bestseller <em>Hostile Takeover: Resisting Centralized Government's Stranglehold on America</em> (2012) and coauthor of <em>Give Us Liberty: A Tea Party Manifesto</em> (2010).

This is the story of the Willoweed family and the English village in which they live. It begins mid-flood, ducks swimming in the drawing-room windows, &#34;quacking their approval&#34; as they sail around the room. &#34;What about my rose beds?&#34; demands Grandmother Willoweed. Her son shouts down her ear-trumpet that the garden is submerged, dead animals everywhere, she will be lucky to get a bunch. Then the miller drowns himself...then the butcher slits his throat...and a series of gruesome deaths plagues the villagers. The newspaper asks, &#34;Who will be smitten by this fatal madness next?&#34; Through it all, Comyns&#39; unique voice weaves a text as wonderful as it is horrible, as beautiful as it is cruel. Originally published in England in 1954, this &#34;overlooked small masterpiece&#34; is a twisted, tragicomic gem.</p><p>Barbara Comyns (1909-92) was born in Bidford-on-Avon in Warwickshire. She was an artist and writer, worked in advertising, dealt in old cars and antiques, bred poodles and developed property. She was twice married, and she and her second husband lived in Spain for eighteen years, returning to the UK in the early 1970s. She is the author of eleven books, including Sisters by a River (1947), Our Spoons Came from Woolworths (1950), The Vet&#39;s Daughter (1959), The Skin Chairs (1962) and A Touch of Mistletoe (1967). She died in Shropshire in 1992.Originally published in 1954 and largely overlooked in its time, Comyns's dark novel begins in the midst of a devastating flood in a small English village. As the "ducks through the drawing-room windows" the Willoweed family surveys the damage. "Grandmother Willoweed" ("a dreadful old black bird, enormous and horrifying, all weighed down by jet and black plumes") shares the estate with her preacher son Ebin, recently made a widower, his three motherless children and their servants, a handyman called Old Ives, and two domestics. Shortly after the flood, several villagers become afflicted with a mysterious illness, causing some to commit suicide. When the pitiful Ebin loses one of his children to the sickness as well, he becomes determined to sever ties with his family's insufferable matriarch and, he hopes, improve his life. Evenson notes in his introduction that Comyns's "third person narration is quite democratic in terms of who it chooses to attend to" and indeed she shifts perspectives from the Willoweeds to various doomed members of the community with the ease and dexterity of a natural storyteller. Her dark, nightmare-inducing imagery makes for an unforgettable read, then and now. (Nov.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

No one lives who may stop the Black Pearl's ascent to the throne, or so it seems. But beneath the streets of Ombria lies a second, shadow Ombria, a buried city inhabited not only by ghosts, but by a powerful, mysterious sorceress and her creation, a girl sculpted from wax.

But after 13 years of marriage and two kids, she was devastated when he left her for a younger woman. Suddenly Stephanie was alone. And after months of trying to find a little romance on New York's wild singles circuit, she was ready to give up, reconciled to just raising her two great, but outspoken, kids. Then a spur-of-the-moment trip to Paris changed everything. <br><br>She met him on the Left Bank. Peter Baker was a marvelously handsome high-tech entrepreneur also visiting the city. Stephanie was certain it couldn't possibly work. Peter was just too perfect. But much to her amazement, he contacted her when they returned to New York. And at the Long Island rental cottage she shared with her kids, Stephanie embarked on a bizarre and hilarious adventure beyond her wildest dreams. <br><br>Shy, serious Peter, chairman of a bionic enterprise, was supposed to be away on business. Instead, he's standing at her door, wearing day-glo satin and rhinestones. Naturally, Stephanie thinks it's a joke--until the truth suddenly dawns: this isn't Peter playing a role. This is his double! Calling himself Paul Klone, this wild, uninhibited creature isn't even remotely like Peter except for his identically sexy good looks. This uproarious novel explores the outrageous love triangle that develops between Stephanie, Peter...and the Klone.<br><br>In a wickedly funny, right-on-target look at finding the perfect mate in an imperfect world, bestselling novelist Danielle Steel reveals insights into the human heart that have made her novels #1 bestsellers around the world.</p><p>Evidently, Danielle Steel has been kidnapped by a mad scientist who clamped her into some gizmo that fused her brain with that of Douglas Adams, author of <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>. While Steel's umpteenth novel, <i>The Klone and I: A High-Tech Love Story</i>, boasts her typical trappings--a divorced heroine, a cruel man, a sexy man with big money, and lots of shopping with brand-name tags conspicuously attached--the book is also the wackiest bit of self-indulgent sci-fi since <i>Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic</i>.<p> <i>The Klone and I</i> starts out normally enough: after a 13-year marriage, Stephanie, 41, gets dumped for a busty young bimbo. "She was gorgeous. And I felt nauseous," Stephanie reflects--though she admits that things hadn't been going well, what with hubby living off her trust fund and their having sex every six months or so. Realistically, their farewell hug goes like this: "My nose ran on his tie, while ever so cautiously he held me, kind of like a bank robber with sticks of dynamite taped all over his body."</p><p> Then, one day, on an impulsive trip to the Left Bank of Paris, Steph steps into one of those cool old French elevators with Peter, a hunk in a button-down Oxford shirt and tasteful khakis. Romance! Ritzy places! In fact, he takes her to the Ritz! Alas, Peter must Louvre her and leave her for a business trip out West. </p><p> So Peter sends Paul to keep her company. Paul is a dead ringer for Peter, because he's a kind of clone created by Peter and his clever biotech company. He's called a "klone" to distinguish him from a conventional clone, which is a mere replica of its original--this "klone" may be a physical copy of Peter, but inside he's had a major id upgrade. As always with Steel, the clue is in the character's clothes: from his high-heel gator boots to his zippered zebra jumpsuit, the decidedly non-buttoned-down Paul dresses like a psychedelic kaleidoscope. But when Paul drops that leopard-satin G-string, watch out! It's quadruple flips in <i>flagrante delicto</i>, with our heroine (and, the next morning, her chiropractor) coming out on top. Though Paul deplorably guzzles Chateau d'Yquem by the case and crashes Peter's Jaguar into snow banks, he's actually even more brilliantly empathic with Stephanie's kids than stuffy Peter is.</p><p> What's a mother to do? Is Steph robbing Peter to play with Paul? How will the m�nage � trois affect marriage plans? Does Steel know that her comic tone (though not her subject) actually slightly echoes that of Betty MacDonald's classic comedy memoir <i>The Egg and I</i>, whose title she alludes to? Is the author a convert from fiction to sci-fi, like Doris Lessing? Will the real Ms. Steel ever reappear, or has her mind been psychedelicized? <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Danielle Steel has been hailed as one of the world's most popular authors, with over 370 million copies of her novels sold.

With the knowledge of someone trained to fashion projectile points with techniques used by the Indians, Justice describes how the points were made, used, and re-sharpened. His detailed drawings illustrate the way the Indians shaped their tools, what styles were peculiar to which regions, and how the various types can best be identified. There are hundreds of drawings, organized by type cluster and other identifying characteristics.

The volumes begin with a series of high-quality color plates illustrating type specimens of each cluster, followed by an identification key.

Shannon </b>is an associate professor of history at Gettysburg College. He is the author of <i>Indians and the Colonists at the Crossroads of Empire</i> as well as numerous scholarly articles.In this scholarly examination of Iroquois diplomacy through the 17th and 18th centuries, historian Shannon rejects the depiction of the Iroquois as noble savages and fierce warriors during the colonization of North America. Instead, he posits, They were flesh and blood participants in a scramble for dominion in North America, and diplomacy was their tool of choice. By maintaining official neutrality during the colonial wars, the Iroquois became key interlocutors in the New World&#x2014;their diplomatic language and rituals became the lingua franca of New World multicultural deal making. Shannon credits the Iroquois strategy of diplomacy and occasional subterfuge with securing their survival as a political entity, pointing out, Other Indians might have fought bravely against the European invaders, but only the Iroquois created a confederacy that was capable of withstanding the juggernaut of colonialization for so long. Shannon meticulously chronicles Iroquois political maneuvering, and although many readers will find the highly technical account tedious, true aficionados of Native American history will relish this serious and sympathetic account of the Iroquois' skilled, if ultimately doomed, diplomacy. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The best thing to say about Alice Munro is said so often, it doesn&#x2019;t mean much anymore. But here it is for the record: She is a master of her craft. In <i>Dear Life</i>, her 13th collection, Munro again breathes life--real, blemished, nuanced life--into her characters and settings (usually her hometown in Huron County, Ontario). Her empathy is the greatest weapon in her arsenal, and it is on full display here. But the most satisfying part of the new collection is the last four stories, bundled together in what the author calls &#x201c;Finale,&#x201d; the closest she&#x2019;ll ever come to writing about her own dear life. --<i>Alexandra Foster</i><b>Alice Munro</b> grew up in Wingham, Ontario, and attended the University of Western Ontario.

Founded by the charismatic Christian Perfectioniost John Humphrey Noyes, this remarkable society flourished for more than thirty years as a unique world where property was shared, men and women were equals, sex was free and open, work was to be joyous, and pleasure was felt to be "the very business that God set Adam and Eve about."</p><p>Spencer Klaw has written for <b>Esquire</b>, <b>Harper's</b>, <b>American Heritage</b>, and <b>The New York Times Magazine</b>, among other magazines and journals. He is the author of <b>The New Brahmins: Scientific Life in America</b> and <b>The Great American Medicine Show</b>. He lives in Connecticut with his wife, Barbara.Disturbing tale of a 19th-century utopian community. Klaw (The Great American Medicine Show, 1975, etc.) wrote this with the cooperation of descendants of the Oneida Community, who granted him access to unpublished memoirs and letters. The result is a thorough if somewhat blinkered look at a daring experiment in social and biological engineering, a sort of Victorian brave new world. Oneida was the brainchild of John Humphrey Noyes, a preacher and writer who believed himself to be God's chosen instrument. Like other utopians, Noyes taught the perfectibility of the human being; more controversially, he also condemned monogamy in favor of sexual libertinism. After some false starts--including an arrest on morals charges--Noyes put his theories to the test in 1848 by establishing his own Eden in Oneida, New York. At first, the community flourished. Inventions poured out, including the stainless-steel cutlery still manufactured today; members enjoyed courses in languages and science, as well as equality in food, clothing, and shelter. But too often Noyes's activities seemed a forerunner of China's cultural revolution. Romantic love and celibacy were banned; at 13 or 14, girls lost their virginity, usually to Noyes himself in sessions known as ``interviews.'' Privacy was nonexistent, and members were subjected to scathing public criticism of their every fault. Noyes ruled as absolute dictator, wielding power by manipulating sexual privileges. His social experiments reached their nadir with ``stirpiculture,'' an attempt to produce superior human beings (with Noyes blood involved, if possible) through breeding experiments. Predictably, the community's idealism faded rapidly, and, by the 1880's, Oneida was more or less defunct. Effectively told, although Klaw is too busy praising Oneida life for its liberalness to grasp the parallels to modern religious cults, including the Branch Davidians.

Yet, within the variety, a certain generic core remains constant: the journey as cultural critique, as exploration beyond society and within oneself.</p><p>This book traces the generic evolution of the road movie with respect to its diverse presentations, emphasizing it as an "independent genre" that attempts to incorporate marginality and subversion on many levels. David Laderman begins by identifying the road movie's defining features and by establishing the literary, classical Hollywood, and 1950s highway culture antecedents that formatively influenced it. He then traces the historical and aesthetic evolution of the road movie decade by decade through detailed and lively discussions of key films. Laderman concludes with a look at the European road movie, from the late 1950s auteurs through Godard and Wenders, and at compelling feminist road movies of the 1980s and 1990s.</p></p><p>David Laderman is Associate Professor of Film at the College of San Mateo, as well as a lecturer in the Cinema Department at San Francisco State University.In 1934, audiences swooned when reporter Clark Gable and heiress Claudette Colbert bickered and then fell in love on a cross-country bus trip in It Happened One Night, an early American road trip movie. America's vast open spaces, colorful and varied locations, multicultural population, and love for cars, mobility, and speed make the road movie a peculiarly (though not exclusively) American fixture. This book is an academic study of American road movies as a "rebellion against conservative social norms" with "an embrace of the journey as a means of cultural critique." The emphasis here is on "outlaw" road movies. Laderman (film, Coll. of San Mateo) discusses literary sources and visions (On the Road), gay road movies (My Own Private Idaho), Native American films (Smoke Signals), and African American (Get on the Bus) and feminist road journeys. He dismisses most comedies, saying they fail to "incorporate any visionary rebellion." Indeed, the author's tone is humorless throughout. His complaint about "heavy-handed" irony in Raising Arizona, for instance, seems to be based on the fact that the irrepressible Coen brothers failed to follow his vision of what a road movie should be. There are some provocative ideas here, but Laderman's rigid approach causes the book to run out of gas. An optional purchase for large American film collections.

He lives in New York.This is a riveting account of organized crime as a way of life. The "wiseguy" (mob parlance for a street-level hoodlum) is Henry Hill, 30-year veteran of a Brooklyn strong-arm branch of the Luchese crime family, who turned against and helped convict his former associates five years ago and entered the Federal Witness Protection Program. Pileggi, a crime reporter for New York writing here with Hill's cooperation, does a superb job of re-creating the gangster's career, from his early days as an errand boy (at 12) to racketeer Paulie Vario in Brooklyn's BrownsvilleEast New York section, to his pivotal roles in a Boston College point-shaving scandal and the $6-million Lufthansa heist at Kennedy Airport in 1978. Hill's story becomes an extraordinary vantage on a demimonde that lives a high, violent, score-to-score life in which car theft, hijacking-to-order, credit-card scams, cigarette smuggling, and other hustles and schemes are as workaday as 9-to-5 at the office.

Afterwards, he attended Ontario College of Education. Although the stage was set for an expert wildlife artist, Bateman moved on to be a high school art/geography teacher.[1] However, he still painted in his free time. It wasn&#39;t until the 1970s and 1980s that his work started to receive major recognition.

Submarine tales inherently are filled with action, adventure, and vivid portraits of<br>extraordinary skill and courage in the face of agonizing death beneath the waves.<br> <b>The Greatest Submarine Stories Ever Told</b> will bring readers, in a single book, some of the most engaging and illuminating prose ever put on paper about submarines. These twenty tales are not just about torpedo and depthcharge attacks, vivid as those are. They are also about feats of exploration, such as the <i>Nautilus</i> nuclear sub surfacing at the North Pole; unusual military feats like the German attack on British ships at Scapa Flow; and the courage and teamwork used to carry out operations when the odds of success and survival seemed nil.<br> The distinguished works excerpted will include, among others: <i>Sharks and Little</i><br><i>Fish</i>; Nautilus <i>90 North</i>; <i>Torpedo Junction</i>, Homer Hickam Jr.&#x2019;s superb account of battles with U-boats off the Atlantic Coast in 1942; and accounts of famous submarine tragedies such as the losses of America&#x2019;s <i>Thresher</i> and Russia&#x2019;s <i>K-19</i>.<br> For readers who like tales brisk with pace and action and the feel of challenging<br>the seven seas, <b>The Greatest Submarine Stories Ever Told</b> will be a much-anticipated new book.<br></p><p><b>Lamar Underwood</b> has edited many books for The Lyons Press, including <i>The Greatest Adventure Stories Ever Told</i>, <i>The Greatest War Stories Ever Told</i>, <i>The Greatest Flying Stories</i> <i>Ever Told</i>, and, more recently, <i>The Quotable Writer</i> and <i>Tales of the Mountain Men</i>.

There are more than 25 million copies of her books in print.In Quick's (Jayne Ann Krentz's pseudonym) mediocre latest installment to the Arcane Society series, Leona Hewitt, a crystal reader, and Thaddeus Ware, a hypnotist, meet trying to steal the same relic&#x2014;the aurora stone&#x2014;from a private collection, but a murdered prostitute and a trap protecting the stone initially complicate their success. Thaddeus, hired by the Arcane Society to claim the stone, allows the plot's loudly grinding gears to ally him with Leona. Both Leona and Thaddeus are sensible and pragmatic, qualities that make for efficient sleuths but passionless lovers, and Quick has to try unusually hard to make their romance believable. The story fares better when it focuses on the crystal and its connections to secret societies, to the Midnight Monster (a hackneyed serial killer) and to Leona's personal history. When the plot threads finally pull taut and the villains' motives and schemes are completely (if clumsily) exposed, Leona is endangered in a suspenseful climax. This is unlikely to garner Quick any new fans, or even delight her devotees, but it will tide them over until the next episode. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When he was still a teenager, George and his family moved to Los Angeles, as many African-American Creole families did, to escape the restrictions of the Jim Crow laws. Herriman never publicly acknowledged his ethnicity, probably fearful of its effects on his reputation. Herriman's death certificate lists him as Caucasian.<br><br>Between 1901 and 1910, Herriman produced his first, regular strip,&nbsp;<i>Musical Mose</i>, as well as other features like&nbsp;<i>Acrobatic Archie</i>,&nbsp;<i>Professor Otto and His Auto</i>,&nbsp;<i>Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade</i>,&nbsp;<i>Mary's Home from College</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Gooseberry Sprig</i>, for the Pulitzer papers and the prestigious T.C. McClure Syndicate.<br><br>In 1910, the artist inaugurated&nbsp;<i>The Dingbat Family</i>, later renamed&nbsp;<i>The Family Upstairs</i>, for&nbsp;<i>The New York Evening Journal</i>, a Hearst paper. The strip featured the adventures of an ordinary family dealing with their annoying upstairs neighbors.<br><br>In&nbsp;<i>The Family Upstairs</i>&nbsp;the artist used the bottom part of each panel to narrate the stories of the Dingbats' pet, Krazy Kat, and a mouse named Ignatz, whose adventures were unrelated to those of the Dingbats. On July 29, 1910, Ignatz Mouse threw an object at Krazy Kat's head for the first time. and bonking Krazy's brain with a brick, with all its attendant meanings, became the strip's main motif. In 1913, Krazy Kat and Ignatz finally had a strip on their own, while&nbsp;<i>The Family Upstairs</i>&nbsp;folded in 1916. It was at this time that Herriman began another strip,<i>&nbsp;Baron Bean</i>, which ran until 1919.<br><br>Herriman's creative use of language narrates the whimsical adventures of three main characters, Krazy, Ignatz, and Offissa Pupp. The unfortunate feline is in love with Ignatz, who does not reciprocate his feelings (or her? Krazy's gender was never clearly established) and likes to hurl bricks at the cat's head. This violent treatment only seems to throw Krazy more deeply in love.&nbsp;<br><br>The strip's subtleties and surrealism never made it very popular with the public en masse, but it had an enthusiastic following among artistic and intellectual circles. Writer Gilbert Seldes dubbed Herriman "the counterpart of Chaplin in the comic film" in his&nbsp;<i>Seven Lively Arts,</i>&nbsp;in 1924. President Woodrow Wilson never missed reading it, and Picasso was reputedly a fan. But the artist's most ardent supporter was William Randolph Hearst. Hearst owned the King Feature Syndicate and refused to drop Herriman's&nbsp;<i>Krazy Kat</i>&nbsp;even when it was carried by fewer than 50 papers. It was Hearst who ordered the strip to be cancelled in 1944, upon learning of Herriman's passing. In his opinion, no one could replace the artist and&nbsp;<i>Krazy Kat&nbsp;</i>was possibly the first strip to die with his creator.Widely acclaimed as the greatest comic strip of all time, George Herriman's Krazy Kat began publication in 1913 and ran until the author's death in 1944. The strip featured a love triangle of sorts between the titular feline, Ignatz Mouse, and Officer Bull Pupp, with Ignatz frequently beaming Krazy with a thrown brick, an act Krazy interpreted as affectionate.<br><br>Over the past several years, Krazy Kat has become more and more accessible with Fantagraphics release of Herriman's full-page Sunday strips, but the dailies have remained by and large unavailable. Which is why IDW Publishing's release last Wednesday of Krazy + Ignatz in Tiger Tea proves so refreshing. The slim volume collects close to a hundred daily strips from the series only extended storyline, published at intervals between May 1936 and March 1937.<br><br>In the storyline, Krazy attempts to help his friend, Mr. Meeyowl, revive his katnip business by going in search of a new product, stumbling only to discover the strange Tiger Tea concoction. When brewed, the substance gives its drinker a ferocious burst of energy, making them feel as if they could take on the whole world...or, in other words, it makes them into mini tigers.<br><br>The Tiger Tea storyline has all of the dynamics and elements that make Krazy Kat so memorable, but taken as a whole and collected between two covers it also reveals some truly revolutionary and ahead of their time moments in the development of comics as an art form.<br><br>As the collection's editor, Craig Yoe, points out in his introduction, a possible impetus for the Tiger Tea storyline could lie in the fact that, just two years prior in 1934, serialized adventure strips became all the rage with Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon, Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates, and Lee Falk's Mandrake the Magician, among others, making their debut.<br><br>While none of these strips could be described as having overly complex or intricate plotlines compared to today s standards, they did have a density of plot that was lacking in comic strips before hand, complete with twists and major climactic segments extended over several days.<br><br>Tiger Tea, on the other hand, reveals a much more decompressed style of storytelling in comparison to the work of someone like Raymond or Caniff. The plot is simple: Krazy finds the Tiger Tea, hijinks ensue. Every now and then he might try to hide it and scare the other characters away from it, but beyond that the story follows one simple throughline, which is really just about the different characters experiences with Tiger Tea.<br><br>More than that, though, Herriman will at times devote a whole day's strip to nothing more than setting up atmosphere. Early on in Krazy's quest, two strips dated June 2 and 6, 1936 are completely silent. The first features Krazy stumbling across a river and swimming along it until it ends in a waterfall; the second begins by Krazy noticing a coming sandstorm, then features two panels of Krazy lost in the storm until the wind pushes him off a cliff and out of the blinding whirlwind.<br><br>Neither strip features much of a punchline, nor do they move the plot forward in any substantial way. Instead, they only serve to illustrate the environment through which Krazy travels. While Herriman couldn't have imagined that his storyline would one day see print as a single book edition, the effect of strips like these is to create a more fulfilling read when the strips are placed in sequence. They let the story breathe in ways that action/adventure strips like Flash Gordon never could.<br><br>Krazy + Ignatz in Tiger Tea represents a small sliver of Herriman's genius, but since it doesn't look like any publisher is planning on mounting a full-scale reprint series of the daily Krazy Kat strips, fans will have to make due with what little helpings of brilliance they can find in this forward-think --Examiner.com</p><h2>The Margaret Rudkin Pepperidge Farm Cookbook</h2><p>The founder of Pepperidge Farms offers five hundred of her favorite recipes for American traditional dishes</p><p></p><h2>Gem Reference Guide</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

Thomas Russell.</b><br><br>Under the command of Captain Charles Hayden, Royal Navy frigate HMS <i>Themis </i>is sent to counter the threat of the French forces in the West Indies. In the middle of the vast Atlantic, Hayden discovers two Spanish noblemen, castaway in a ship&#x2019;s boat&#x2014;a stroke of almost impossible good fortune. The Spaniards&#x2019; explanation for their plight seems so improbable that Hayden&#x2019;s officers suspect them of being criminals or even spies. But they have secrets far more shocking than that&#x2014;secrets which will haunt Hayden in his new posting.<br><br>Upon reaching the Barbados station, Hayden finds himself under the command of the vainglorious Sir William Jones, an impetuous and foolhardy officer. Refusing orders will cost Hayden his command. But accepting them might cost him his ship, his crew...and his life.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>S. Thomas Russell </b>is a lifelong sailor whose passion for the sea inspired <i>Until the Sea Shall Give Up Her Dead</i>, <i>Take, Burn or Destroy</i>, <i>A Battle Won</i>, and <i>Under Enemy Colors</i>.<p></p><p>One</p><p>Lady Hattingale, accompanied by the physician, descended the great stair a few steps at a time, paused, her head inclined and nodding at the doctor&#x2019;s words, and then undertook the next three steps. The butler awaited them at the bottom, a near-statue of discretion and deferment. When the physician and the noblewoman came near he whispered a few words and both physician and lady turned their attention to Charles Hayden, who waited ten paces distant.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Hayden,&#x201d; she said, crossing towards him.</p><p>Hayden made a leg. &#x201c;Lady Hattingale.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dr Goodwin, our physician.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have come to enquire of Lord Arthur,&#x201d; she said&#x2014;it was not a question.</p><p>&#x201c;And to speak with him if it is possible.&#x201d;</p><p>Lady Hattingale glanced at the physician, who seemed to consider this request most seriously.</p><p>&#x201c;I do not think it would do any great harm,&#x201d; the doctor decreed. &#x201c;Ten minutes, though, no more. Do not speak on any subject that might cause him distress.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is he yet so fragile?&#x201d; Hayden asked.</p><p>&#x201c;He lost a great deal of blood. I am still somewhat surprised that he survived. But the young are full of surprises.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And his arm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We will see. I think he will keep it, but he may never have full use of it again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Dr Goodwin,&#x201d; Hayden said, &#x201c;for all you have done.&#x201d;</p><p>The man made a modest nod. &#x201c;Who is your surgeon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Obadiah Griffiths.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Carry him my compliments. I do not think Lord Arthur would have survived without his timely ministrations.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I will very gladly do so,&#x201d; Hayden replied.</p><p>Lady Hattingale saw the doctor to the door and the butler took Hayden up to Lord Arthur. He was let into a large, sun-flooded room, where he found Wickham buried under a sea of white coverlets. The midshipman&#x2019;s face beamed like a lighthouse upon seeing his shipmate.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Hayden, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is a cosy little cabin they have given you, Wickham. You must be an admiral now to have such a cot.&#x201d; Hayden sat down upon a bedside chair. &#x201c;You are pale as a cloud. I have seen fish bellies not half so white as you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am told I left half my allotment of blood upon the deck of our ship, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Someone is always cleaning up after you reefers.&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you speak to Dr Goodwin, sir? Did he say when I might be allowed on my feet again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He did not. All he said was that you are recovering apace and that you should be playing the fiddle again in a fortnight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My mother will be most happy to hear it. I was a terrible disappointment as a musical prodigy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, there, you see, one advantage already&#x2014;a happy mother.&#x201d;</p><p>Both fell silent a moment.</p><p>&#x201c;Did we lose many men, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We took losses, yes. But all our <i>Themis</i>es came through unharmed, you excepted. Did I never tell you not to stand in the way of a musket ball?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You did, sir, but I forgot myself in all the excitement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is why you should listen to your elders, for I am four and twenty and you are but six and ten.&#x201d;</p><p>Again a silence settled around them.</p><p>&#x201c;I am told there is to be a medal, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is the rumour. All the captains Lord Howe saw fit to mention in his missives to the Admiralty are to receive a medal for their part in the battle on June first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You must have been mentioned, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;By some miracle, I was. I did not think the admiral knew my name. He did not, however, mention a number of captains who I am certain shall feel they have been slighted. I expect there will be a great deal of resultant ill will.&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham nodded, as there was nothing new in this; admirals always had their favourites. &#x201c;Have you any news, sir? Are we given orders?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>I</i> have been given orders. Y<i>ou</i> are to rest and recover.&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham nodded and glanced away, blinking.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is <i>Raisonnable</i> bound, if a mere landsman may ask?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are no landsman, Wickham, but only temporarily aground. The spring tide will float you off. I am the captain of <i>Raisonnable</i> no more, but have been given a new ship. One you are more than a little familiar with. <i>Themis</i> is her name&#x2014;a fine frigate with a black character.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Themis</i>, sir!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Indeed, and we are sent on convoy duty into the Baltic, with most of your old shipmates aboard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why, sir, whenaway? Mayhap I will be recovered enough to take ship with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We sail within the week, but I expect you to buckle down and recover so you will be ship shape when we return. Mr Stephens has informed me that it is likely we will be sent to the West Indies after the hurricane season has passed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;November, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not before December, I should think. That gives you some goodly amount of time to complete your refit and resume your station aboard.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I shall set the dockyard hands to work on my ailing limb immediately, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am happy to hear it. The midshipmen&#x2019;s berth has become a nursery, full of children who do not know which end is which&#x2014;and I am talking about their person, not the ship. I need you back to instruct these boys in the finer points of being an officer in His Majesty&#x2019;s Navy.&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham grinned. &#x201c;I remember, sir, when I first set foot aboard in my new rig with gleaming buttons and snow-white breeches.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I remember my first days as well. I could hardly comprehend a thing that went on around me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was the same, sir. And then a new, young lieutenant came aboard and taught us all what service meant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know those new lieutenants, all brash and thinking they know all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope to be one myself, some day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were an excellent acting lieutenant, Wickham, and not in the least brash or all-knowing. Why, I should recommend you to any theatre company, you were so convincing.&#x201d;</p><p>This almost put a hint of colour into the midshipman&#x2019;s face, and he appeared to search for something to say.</p><p>&#x201c;I have been reading the papers,&#x201d; Wickham offered, &#x201c;one-handed.&#x201d; He tried to smile. &#x201c;Do you think that Robespierre can survive the summer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do not know,&#x201d; Hayden said, feeling his spirits sink. He had had no news of his family in France for many months. &#x201c;The Committee is sending anyone to the guillotine, almost without trial&#x2014;a mere accusation is enough to take a man&#x2019;s head. It is a frightening time to be French. There must be a backlash against this&#x2014;there must be a return to reason.&#x201d;</p><p>The door opened then and Lady Hattingale entered. Immediately, Hayden rose to his feet.</p><p>&#x201c;Please sit, Captain Hayden,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I am but a nursing sister here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your ministrations have worked a small miracle,&#x201d; Hayden observed. &#x201c;This midshipman appears well on his way to a full recovery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He is doing splendidly, but forcing him to rest is my greatest contribution&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which he resists at all times. Perhaps, Captain, you might order him to stay abed until the doctor allows him to quit it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr Wickham, I hereby order you to rest until this good nurse and the physician allow you to rise. In fact, you are to follow their instructions in every detail. Do you comprehend what I am saying?&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham nodded submissively. &#x201c;Aye, sir. I shall do all within my power to be a better invalid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it is not in my nature.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Hayden responded, &#x201c;it is not, but you will be back aboard ship the sooner for a little patience, I am certain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it three o&#x2019;clock already?&#x201d; Lady Hattingale enquired as the mantel clock chimed. &#x201c;You see, Lord Arthur, how quickly time speeds? You shall be on your feet in no time at all.&#x201d;</p><p>Hayden took the hint and rose.</p><p>&#x201c;I must bid you adieu, Lady Hattingale, and thank you again for all you have done for Lord Arthur. We all believe he will be an admiral one day, if he does not want to be Prime Minister.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He will make a better admiral, I think,&#x201d; she answered, and rose as well. &#x201c;Let me walk you out, Captain.&#x201d; Then, to Wickham: &#x201c;You have your orders, Lord Arthur. Rest. I shall find you another book to read.&#x201d;</p><p>Hayden gave a nod to Wickham, who touched an invisible hat with his good hand.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you for coming, sir. Remember me to the others.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do not think they have forgotten; they ask about you hourly. We will be back from our convoy in a few weeks and I will look in on you at that time. Be well.&#x201d;</p><p>Wickham gave a nod, appearing suddenly unable to speak.</p><p>Hayden and Lady Hattingale went into the hallway beyond, and towards the stair. She was a very tall woman of perhaps fifty years, though she carried these lightly. She was elegantly but simply dressed and wore no jewellery&#x2014;not even a ring. To Hayden she seemed a practical and steady woman&#x2014;just the sort he would choose to nurse his unlucky midshipman.</p><p>&#x201c;He appears thin as a whip,&#x201d; Hayden observed.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, he very nearly did not survive,&#x201d; Lady Hattingale replied, shaking her head but a little. &#x201c;I thank God that he is on the mend and hope he does not take a sudden turn. Lord and Lady Sanstable will arrive presently.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I expected them here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They were visiting in the north but I am certain set out the very instant they had word.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am sorry not to have met them. Lord Sanstable has been a good friend to both me and my ship.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And well he should be,&#x201d; she said, and smiled. &#x201c;Lord Arthur worships the ground you walk upon&#x2014;or perhaps I should say &#x2018;deck.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I cannot imagine that is true.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lord Sanstable is convinced you have been a great and good influence upon his son.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder if His Lordship will feel the same after he has seen his son so gravely hurt?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could protect him only at the cost of his honour,&#x201d; Lady Hattingale very wisely observed. &#x201c;Lord Sanstable comprehends this.&#x201d;</p><p>The final stair was reached and in a moment they arrived at the great entrance.</p><p>Hayden paused. &#x201c;Thank you again, Lady Hattingale, for all you have done for Lord Arthur.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have known him since the day his mother brought him into this world, Captain Hayden. I could not have done less and wish I might do more.&#x201d;</p><p>Hayden was out the door, where a groom stood waiting with his hired horse. Portsmouth was but a short ride, and all the way there Hayden found himself overcome with the most morbid feelings and such tides of emotion that he could hardly keep his saddle. All of the midshipmen were his charges, given into his safekeeping by apprehensive parents. But the truth was he could not keep them safe. He could try to make them good sea officers, but they would ever face mortal danger. Wickham, he realised, had become something of a prot�g�&#x2014;more like a nephew than a young gentleman. Of course, it flattered Hayden to think of himself somehow part of such a distinguished family&#x2014;for he was of more modest stock. But musket balls did not care what colour blood they spilled&#x2014;blue or red, it was all the same to them. That was the harsh truth of the sea officer&#x2019;s life. Anyone who stood upon a quarterdeck was a target for enemy fire. Hayden, Archer, Wickham&#x2014;they could all easily end their lives sewn up in a hammock, slipped over the side into a dark, watery grave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there to wait until the sea shall give up her dead.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>It began as an uneventful crossing&#x2014;if crossing a vast and volatile ocean in the dead of winter could ever be construed as uneventful. A three-day gale in mid-December, however, changed all that and set in chain a series of &#x201c;events&#x201d; unlike any Hayden had ever known or even imagined.</p><p>To begin, three men were thrown down from aloft; two broke on the deck and departed this life upon that instant, but the third, beyond all odds, landed upon one of his fellows, who had not heard the cries, and now it appeared to be a question of which would live, for both lay in the sick-berth sorely hurt.</p><p>The next event was less dramatic but infinitely more sensitive. Hayden had been prevailed upon by Admiral Caldwell, the commander-in-chief of the Barbados station, to carry the admiral&#x2019;s secretary out with him. The man, who was also a cousin to the admiral&#x2019;s wife, was presently installed in a cabin in the <i>Themis</i>&#x2019; gunroom. And it was in regard to this particular gentleman that Lieutenant Benjamin Archer had approached his captain.</p><p>Beyond the gallery windows, night&#x2019;s sullen tide gathered on the eastern horizon. Across the sky, however, quickly fading shades of pale purple, rose, and gold appeared to have been pastelled upon the clouds. Shortly, a servant would slip in to light the lamps. The frigate&#x2019;s cabin, which had once seemed as grand as a ballroom to Hayden, now appeared cramped and dreary compared to the great cabin he had so recently vacated upon the sixty-four-gun ship <i>Raisonnable</i>. He had been too junior a captain to retain such a command and now he was back on the ship no other officer wanted, his rise and fall so rapid he had barely a moment to register either. At least, he reminded himself, he had retained his post. <i>And</i> he was not headed north into the Baltic on convoy duty, where he had so recently spent several cold, wet months, often fog bound and land-blind. Instead, he shaped his ship&#x2019;s course towards the West Indies, and the warmth of those verdant islands had reached out to the crew of the <i>Themis</i> the previous week.</p><p>Archer stood in his usual post-somnolent state, uniform not quite dishevelled enough to provoke comment. In his hand he held a small square of cream-coloured paper, neatly folded. The young lieutenant was struggling to find some way to begin and looked sheepish or, perhaps, embarrassed, Hayden could not say which.</p><p>&#x201c;And what is it, exactly, that Mr Percival has done to distress you so, Mr Archer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he has given a poem to Mr Maxwell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The cherub?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Midshipman Maxwell had been dubbed &#x201c;the cherub&#x201d; the instant he had set foot on the deck, for no one aboard had ever seen a youngster who so resembled a seraph, from his curly, yellow locks and rosy cheeks to his rather angelic smile.</p><p>&#x201c;That hardly seems a capital offence&#x2014;unless it is a particularly bad poem.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is rather good, sir, but then his claim to have written it is somewhat exaggerated, as I believe a player by the name of Shakespeare wrote a very similar poem some years past.&#x201d; He held the poem out to the somewhat mystified Hayden.</p><p>Hayden unfolded the paper, and there, in a very beautiful hand, was written:</p><p>Shall I compare thee to a summer&#x2019;s day?</p><p>Thou art more lovely and more temperate.</p><p>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</p><p>And summer&#x2019;s lease hath all too short a date.</p><p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</p><p>And often is his gold complexion dimmed</p><p>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</p><p>By chance or nature&#x2019;s changing course untrimmed;</p><p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade</p><p>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#x2019;st.</p><p>Nor shall Death brag thou wander&#x2019;st in his shade</p><p>When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#x2019;st.</p><p>So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</p><p>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p><p>&#x201c;So Mr Percival gave this poem to Mr Maxwell, claiming it to be of his own making&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to impress our young midsh...</p></p><h2>American Manners and Customs-1 A Guide for Newcomers</h2><p>American Manners and Customs is an anthology of 22 easy-to-read articles from Easy English NEWS, our award-winning newspaper for newcomers.

There is a plot in motion that will burn the world in the fires of holy war.</p><p><b>Chris Kuzneski </b>is the internationally bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Secret Crown, The Prophecy</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Lost Throne</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sword of God</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sign of the Cross</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Plantation</i>. His thrillers have been published in more than 20 languages and are sold in more than 40 countries.&nbsp;He grew up in Pennsylvania and now lives on the Gulf Coast of Florida.Retired soldiers Jonathon Payne and D.J. Jones return to action (after last year's <i>Sign of the Cross</i>), investigating a secret bunker off the coast of Korea where a gruesome scene and a missing squad from their former unit, an elite counterinsurgency team, indicate that secret interrogation proceedings have gone terribly wrong. Piecing together the facts of the case lead Payne and Jones to Mecca, where a plot to blow up the Grand Mosque suggests a global conspiracy to align forces against the United States. Soon Payne and Jones have to risk their lives to infiltrate Mecca (where non-Muslims can be summarily executed) to save the city and, ultimately, the world. Kuzneski's novel is taut and largely fast-paced; though occasionally bogged down in historical exposition, it's a fair trade that gives the book a rich sense of authenticity and plausibility. Though characters are short on depth, Kuzneski knows how to maintain a nuanced moral landscape while wresting maximum thrills from contemporary Western fear of terrorism. This globe-crossing action thriller, like its predecessor, evokes the spirit of Dan Brown, with welcome doses of Lee Child's ex-military tough-guy grit. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Set in a gritty downtown urban milieu of late-night clubs and a decadent art scene where all past ties seem severed, Kink is at once spellbindingly erotic and determined - in brilliant studies of character, motivation, manipulation, and spiritual unease - to portray both the possibilities for personal transformation and the dead-end games of moral bankruptcy.</p><p>With a blend of erotic and gothic sensibilities, Koja explores the facets of obsession in a three-way relationship between a man and two women set against the gritty downtown backdrop of late-night clubs and a decadent art scene. Gripping and sensuous, dark and edgy, <b>Kink</b> is a tantalizing read.Her prose style like a buzz saw shearing through layers of consciousness, Koja (Strange Angels, 1994, etc.) continues her rampage through the land of eros, again framing her penchant for trios and S&amp;M in a bleak but ever-so-trendy downtown art scene. Narrator Jess, a happy-go-lucky temp worker, and his childlike hairdressing soulmate Sophie think they have it all just because they have each other: They play their game to the hilt, making out anywhere, anytime--and so much the better with an audience. Their lusty play maintains an earthy innocence, however, until they meet cool, sophisticated, exquisite Lena, who gives them a new word for their sport--``kink''--and with whom they immediately bond. What starts as a friendship with sexual overtones changes character when Lena moves in with them; her allure ties Jess in knots until he gains the object of his desire, and a menage ... trois is born. But Sophie and Lena are a hot item, too, and so poor Jess is blindsided when--so overwhelmed by his passion that he wants Sophie out of the picture (and believing that Lena is in agreement)--he forces the issue and becomes the odd man out. Obsessed with Lena even after her betrayal, he compulsively tracks down her acquaintances, from space-cadet sculptor Edie to filmmaker Annemarie, and finally the powerful, aging Saul, who starred with Lena in Annemarie's XXX- rated ``art film'' Peril, gaining an ugly but consistent picture of her romantic conquests and mastery of the three-way from her wrecks of ex-mates. Eventually his new knowledge--along with a helping hand from Sophie--enables him to trade in his obsession for the hope of a more balanced relationship. There's immense power here in the style and titillating subject matter but also a chilling sense that one is being manipulated, all the right buttons being pushed, from the first page down to the sap-happy ending. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

From the flashing needles of the tailors in the costume shop to the zoo where the animals were trained, from the matzo ball soup in the commissary to the blinding-�white offices in the brand-�new Thalberg executive building, an army of people&#x2014;�composers and musicians, technicians and tinsmiths, directors and actors&#x2014;�spun thread into gold. Once upon a time, dreams were made by hand, but now they were mass-�produced. These forty-�four acres were their assembly line.<br><br>Outside its walls, the brown hills, tidy neighborhoods, and rusting oil derricks of Culver City gave no hint of magic; but within the gates of M-�G-�M&#x2014;�Metro, as it was known&#x2014;�you stepped inside an enchanted kingdom. A private trolley line that cut through the center of the studio&#x2019;s back lots could whisk you across the world, or back in time&#x2014;�from old New York&#x2019;s Brownstone Row to the Wild West&#x2019;s Billy the Kid Street to Renaissance Italy&#x2019;s Verona Square&#x2014;�with no stops in the outside world. In 1938, more than three thousand people labored inside these walls. Just as the Emerald City was the center of the Land of Oz, so the M-�G-�M Studios were the beating heart of that mythic place called Hollywood.<br>Maud Baum had been waiting on foot outside the massive front gates of Metro-�Goldwyn-�Mayer for almost an hour, just another face among the throngs of visitors hoping for a chance to get inside. Every now and again, a gleaming automobile pulled up to the gate. Each time, the studio&#x2019;s guard snapped to attention and offered a crisp salute. Whenever this happened, the fans waiting around the entrance, hoping to catch a peek of the stars, would leap forward, thrusting bits of papers through the car&#x2019;s windows. As Maud observed this spectacle, she couldn&#x2019;t help but feel a pang for Frank: his doomed Oz Manufacturing Film Company, a single giant barnlike structure, had been just a short distance away from the current location of this thriving metropolis of Metro. In 1914, when Frank had opened his company, Hollywood had been a sleepy backwater of orange trees and bungalows, and filmmaking a crazy venture seen as a passing fad. If only he could have lived to see what a movie studio would become over the course of the next two decades: another White City, a giant theater stage. This fantastical place was the concrete manifestation of what Frank had been able to imagine long before it had come to pass.<br><br>At last it was Maud&#x2019;s turn. As the guard scribbled her a pass, her stomach fluttered. Inside her purse, she had the small cutout torn from Variety. She didn&#x2019;t need to look at it; she had long since memorized its few words: &#x201c;oz&#x201d; sold to louis b. mayer at m-�g-�m. As the last living link to the inspiration behind the story, she was determined to offer her services as a consultant. But getting access to the studio had not been easy. For months, they had rebuffed her calls, only reluctantly setting up a meeting with the studio head, Louis B. Mayer, because the receptionist was no doubt fed up with answering her daily queries. Today she would make her case.<br><br>If Maud&#x2019;s suffragist mother, Matilda, had taught her anything, it was that if you wanted something, you needed to ask for it&#x2014;�or demand it, if necessary. True, Maud would far rather be reading a book at Ozcot, her Hollywood home, but she had made a promise to her late husband that she aimed to keep.<br><br>The guard pushed her day pass through the glass-�fronted window and gave her a nod.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is the Thalberg Building?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>He jerked his head to the left&#x2014;�a gesture that could have pointed anywhere. &#x201c;White Lung? Just head that way. You can&#x2019;t miss it.&#x201d;<br><br>White Lung? What a peculiar name for a building. Maud was about to ask him why, but as she&#x2019;d aged she&#x2019;d learned to keep her thoughts to herself so as not to come off as a doddering old fool.<br><br>Inside the studio&#x2019;s gates, the paths and private roads were crowded with people and vehicles. A knot of actors hurried by, costumed in elaborate ball gowns, paste jewels, and powdered wigs, followed by painters in splattered coveralls, a man humming a tune to himself, and another fellow, likely a writer, with a furrowed brow and a pencil tucked behind his ear. Maud leapt out of the way as three girls whizzed past on bicycles. Having spent much time in the theater, she was reminded of the bustle of backstage, but this&#x2014;�this was such an immense scale&#x2014;�all the world&#x2019;s a stage! Frank had loved to quote Shakespeare. Here, it seemed to be literally true.<br><br>The Art Moderne Thalberg Building was dazzlingly white, its fresh exterior paint as clean as snow. A few scaffoldings still crept up one side&#x2014;�the building was clearly brand-�new. When she stepped inside the polished lobby, she felt a chill prickle her skin and heard an odd wheezing sound like an old man breathing. She pulled her cardigan tighter around her shoulders as the receptionist gave her a sympathetic look.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the air conditioner,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Like a heater for cool.&#x201d;<br><br>Maud suppressed a smile. Such a Frank-�like idea. A heater for cool. He was always saying backward things like that.<br><br>&#x201c;May I help you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am here to see Mr. Louis B. Mayer.&#x201d; Maud made sure that her voice conveyed no hint of hesitation. She who hesitates is lost. That was another of Matilda&#x2019;s expressions. Seventy-�seven years old and Maud sometimes still felt as if her mother were perched just behind the wings, whispering stage instructions.<br><br>The receptionist was a young woman with a well-�coiffed platinum bob. &#x201c;Actress?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Most definitely not.&#x201d;<br><br>The girl raised a stylishly penciled eyebrow and gave Maud the once-�over, from her gray curls down to her sturdy brown pumps.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you&nbsp;. . . ?&#x201d; She leaned in. &#x201c;His mother?&#x201d;<br><br>To her credit, Maud did not show her irritation. &#x201c;Mrs. L. Frank Baum. I have an appointment.&#x201d;<br><br>The young woman narrowed her eyes, the rubber tip of her pencil ticking down the list. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mrs. Baum. You aren&#x2019;t on Mr. Mayer&#x2019;s schedule.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Check again,&#x201d; Maud insisted. &#x201c;One o&#x2019;clock. I made this appointment weeks ago.&#x201d; She wouldn&#x2019;t let them turn her away now. She&#x2019;d been waiting too long for this day to arrive.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to speak to Mrs. Koverman&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; She dropped her voice. &#x201c;Mount Ida. No one gets to Mr. Mayer without going through her first.&#x201d;<br><br>Maud smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite adept at going through people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Take the elevator to the third floor. Mrs. Koverman&#x2019;s desk will be right in front of you.&#x201d;<br><br>As Maud waited for the elevator, her blurry reflection looked back at her from the shining brass of the twin doors. She hoped that her expression reflected a resoluteness of spirit, rather than the trepidation she was now feeling as this important meeting was at last upon her.<br><br>&#x201c;Third floor,&#x201d; she said to the uniformed elevator man, stepping inside.<br><br>When the doors slid open, she faced a secretary&#x2019;s desk with a plaque that read mrs. ida koverman. A stout matron with bobbed brown hair inspected Maud.<br><br>&#x201c;Maud Baum,&#x201d; Maud said. &#x201c;I have an appointment with Mr. Louis B. Mayer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On what business?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My late husband&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; Maud was horrified to hear her voice squeak.<br><br>Mrs. Koverman looked at her with no trace of sympathy.<br><br>&#x201c;My late husband, Mr. L. Frank Baum, was the author of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Koverman&#x2019;s expression did not soften.<br><br>Maud had long since noted that there were two kinds of people in the world: fans of Oz&#x2014;�those who remembered their childhoods&#x2014;�and those who pretended that they had never even heard of Oz, who believed that adults should put away childish things. From the look on her face, Mrs. Koverman fell into the latter category.<br><br>&#x201c;Have a seat.&#x201d; She cut off any further conversation with a vigorous clacking of her typewriter keys.<br><br>Maud sat, feet crossed at the ankle, handbag and a well-�worn copy of Oz balanced on her lap, hoping to convey that she wasn&#x2019;t planning on going anywhere.<br><br>Every now and again, Mrs. Koverman would stand up and rap upon the door with the brass plaque on it reading louis b. mayer, then enter with a piece of typed paper or a phone message. Each time she emerged, Maud looked at her steadily while Mrs. Koverman avoided her gaze. Once in a while, Maud glanced at her wristwatch. Soon one-�thirty had come and gone.<br><br>The two women might have remained in their silent test of wills had not a large commotion ensued from the elevator bay&#x2014;�a loud thwack and a cry of &#x201c;Bugger all!&#x201d; filled the room. Maud was astonished to see a giant young man&#x2014;�well over six feet tall&#x2014;�rubbing his head, then bending over to gather up a scattered pile of papers from the floor. Most surprising, a brand-�new edition of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz had skidded across the floor, landing almost at Maud&#x2019;s feet.<br><br>She picked it up and approached the man. &#x201c;I believe you&#x2019;ve lost this?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he said with a British accent. &#x201c;Just give me a minute. I&#x2019;m a bit dazed.&#x201d;<br><br>Maud watched with alarm as the lanky man swayed like a tall pine on a windy day. But after a moment, he straightened his tie, took the book from Maud, and held out his other hand in greeting. &#x201c;Noel Langley. Scenarist.&#x201d;<br><br>He noted the faded clothbound volume Maud held in her other hand. &#x201c;Doing a little homework, I see.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Homework?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me guess. Are you playing Auntie Em?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Auntie Em?&#x201d; Maud was startled. She peered at the man, confused. &#x201c;But how could you&nbsp;. . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Clara Blandick,&#x201d; Langley continued, not seeming to notice Maud&#x2019;s reaction. &#x201c;I presume&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, the actress?&#x201d; Maud said, gathering her wits. &#x201c;You mean the actress?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, the actress,&#x201d; Langley said, louder this time. Maud blinked in irritation.<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all. I&#x2019;m not an actress,&#x201d; Maud said firmly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Maud Baum&#x2014;�Mrs. L.

I guess, I assumed&#x2014;�oh, never mind what I assumed&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not to worry,&#x201d; Maud said soothingly. &#x201c;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was published in 1900. The turn of the century.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, yes&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; Langley said. His blush had faded, but the tips of his auricles remained pink.<br><br>&#x201c;Must seem like ancient history to a young man like you.&#x201d; Maud&#x2019;s heart sank at the thought.<br><br>Langley nodded in agreement.<br><br>&#x201c;Which brings up a good point,&#x201d; Maud said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a lucky chance I&#x2019;ve run into you. You see&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Before Maud had a chance to finish, the elevator doors slid open again and a brown-�haired man seemed to blow out as if pushed by a strong wind.<br><br>&#x201c;Langley!&#x201d; he cried out.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; the tall fellow answered. &#x201c;Look what we have here&nbsp;. . . if you can believe it. It&#x2019;s Mrs. L. Frank Baum. Mrs. Baum, this is Mervyn LeRoy. He&#x2019;s the producer.&#x201d;<br><br>LeRoy skidded to a stop in front of the pair and looked Maud up and down.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;ll be,&#x201d; he said, appearing mystified at her presence.<br><br>LeRoy&#x2019;s gaze fell upon the faded green book Maud clasped in her bony, spotted hands.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, now, look at this.&#x201d; LeRoy reached out. &#x201c;This looks like the exact same edition I had when I was a kid&nbsp;. . . sat on the shelf right by my bed. Loved that book so much.&#x201d;<br><br>Maud sensed an opening. &#x201c;Would you like to take a look?&#x201d;<br><br>She held out the worn volume, the color leached from its cover and its edges frayed. Before cracking it open, LeRoy inhaled its papery scent, then reverently brushed the palm of his hand across the stamped green cloth. Flipping it open, he perused the color illustrations one by one, a half-�smile on his lips.<br><br>&#x201c;I grew up reading this book. Loved it! It&#x2019;s hard to explain. I almost felt as if the characters were part of my own family.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am glad to hear you feel that way. So you&#x2019;ll understand why it&#x2019;s so important to stick to the author&#x2019;s vision.&#x201d;<br><br>LeRoy tore his eyes away from the volume in his hands and returned his gaze to Maud, whose corporeal presence he still seemed to find puzzling. &#x201c;The author&#x2019;s vision? Tell the truth, I never gave a moment&#x2019;s thought to the person who wrote it. Oz always seemed so timeless&#x2014;�eternal, really.

Juno magazine</p><h2>Lolita</h2><p>In the decades since its first publication,<i>&nbsp;Lolita</i> has emerged as a classic of contemporary literature. Poet and pervert, Humbert becomes obsessed by twelve-year-old Lolita and seeks to possess her, first carnally and then artistically, out of love. This seduction is one of the many dimensions in Nabokov's dizzying masterpiece, which is suffused with rich, elaborate verbal textures.</p><p>Despite its lascivious reputation, the pleasures of <i>Lolita</i> are as much intellectual as erogenous. It is a love story with the power to raise both chuckles and eyebrows. Humbert Humbert is a European intellectual adrift in America, haunted by memories of a lost adolescent love. When he meets his ideal nymphet in the shape of 12-year-old Dolores Haze, he constructs an elaborate plot to seduce her, but first he must get rid of her mother. In spite of his diabolical wit, reality proves to be more slippery than Humbert's feverish fantasies, and Lolita refuses to conform to his image of the perfect lover.<p> Playfully perverse in form as well as content, riddled with puns and literary allusions, Nabokov's 1955 novel is a hymn to the Russian-born author's delight in his adopted language. Indeed, readers who want to probe all of its allusive nooks and crannies will need to consult the annotated edition. <i>Lolita</i> is undoubtedly, brazenly erotic, but the eroticism springs less from the "frail honey-hued shoulders ... the silky supple bare back" of little Lo than it does from the wantonly gorgeous prose that Humbert uses to recount his forbidden passion: </p><blockquote> She was musical and apple-sweet ... Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice ... and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty--between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock. </blockquote> Much has been made of <i>Lolita</i> as metaphor, perhaps because the love affair at its heart is so troubling. Humbert represents the formal, educated Old World of Europe, while Lolita is America: ripening, beautiful, but not too bright and a little vulgar. Nabokov delights in exploring the intercourse between these cultures, and the passages where Humbert describes the suburbs and strip malls and motels of postwar America are filled with both attraction and repulsion, "those restaurants where the holy spirit of Huncan Dines had descended upon the cute paper napkins and cottage-cheese-crested salads." Yet however tempting the novel's symbolism may be, its chief delight--and power--lies in the character of Humbert Humbert. He, at least as he tells it, is no seedy skulker, no twisted destroyer of innocence. Instead, Nabokov's celebrated mouthpiece is erudite and witty, even at his most depraved. Humbert can't help it--linguistic <i>jouissance</i> is as important to him as the satisfaction of his arrested libido. <i>--Simon Leake</i>Critics are just beginning to hail Jeremy Irons' performance for Random House AudioBooks...<p><b>"a road trip to hell in a luxury sedan." </b><br>--Salon Magazine</p><p><b>"In his reading Irons recreates the clarity, precision, and lilt of every glorious sentence." </b><br>--The Washington Post</p><p><b>"Nabokov said Lolita was the record of his love affair with the English language; Irons makes it a menage a trois." </b><br>-- Vogue</p><p><b>"[Irons's] efforts have placed this superb audio on my life list, to be saved for repeated listening."</b><br>--Boston Globe</p><p>" . . . most praiseworthy of all the audio efforts I've heard . . ."<br>-- Men's Journal</p><p><b>"Irons' inspired reading is not to be missed."</b><br> -- Chicago Tribune</p><p><b>"...a beautifully produced recording that pushes the boundaries of the audio medium.<br> . . . hands down the best audio production of the year." </b><br>-- Library Journal</p><p><b>"Irons reads with wickedly understated malevolence, preserving Humbert's foolish patrician airs.

But White was, if nothing else, a man able to endure difficulties, to overcome hardships, to shrug off adversities that would defeat even above-average specimens of mere humanity.<br><br>True, he was not particularly blessed with patience--that attribute had always eluded him. Nor was grace in the face of frustration his long suit; forbearance in the presence of mediocrity--not his forte. Nor was compassion a trait he considered worth cultivating. So in his lack of "sensitivity," he seemed--to the second- and third-rate minds he so often encountered--cruel, even cold.<br><br>But such (wrongly) perceived cruelty and coldness only bespoke a superiority of mind and spirit, the end result of thousands of years of selective breeding; and, as such, were part and parcel of his ability to prevail. Anyway, Ames White was free of most of these primitive "human" emotions, though admittedly vestiges remained. He had loved a woman, once; and he loved his son.<br><br>But that was family. Breeding. That was allowed, even encouraged.<br><br>And Ames White was possessed with a dark, wicked streak of humor. He could well appreciate the irony of a "cold" character like himself finding refuge in the bitterly frigid Dene Tha town of Meander River, Alberta, Canada.<br><br>Its population no larger than the Sunday crowd in a Seattle marketplace, Meander River had taken him about as far north as he could manage, short of renting a dogsled. The people who lived here were so removed from civilization that White wondered if these subhumans had even heard about the Pulse, let alone felt its repercussions.<br><br>The Meander River economy was based on barter, and the citizens had very little use for computers, which meant scant had changed here, after what had been a cataclysm to the nearby United States. When terrorists set off an electromagnetic pulse over the East Coast back in 2009, the USA had lost everything, a superpower instantly reduced to the status of Third World nation. To Meander River, the event was as trivial as an electrical outage in a thunderstorm.<br><br>Buried under a mound of snow measured in feet, not inches, Meander River was the perfect vacation getaway for the person who didn't want to be found by persnickety types . . . NSA federal bosses, say, who might be annoyed that a certain agent had gone rogue; or the Familiars, White's breeding cult family, who might be ticked that one of their own had failed in every one of his mission objectives, and could merit a reprimand . . . the fatal kind.<br><br>If those were the kinds of people you needed a vacation from, then Meander River had much to offer. Not only was there the biting cold and daunting snow, Meander River was also over three hours from the nearest pre-Pulse landing strip, and a good twelve hours from Edmonton and a real airport. Those conditions did not make travel to this fugitive's frozen paradise a simple proposition, particularly only a week before Christmas when the average high for the day was still well below zero.<br><br>Meander River was also located in the middle of the Dene Tha Native Reserve. Back in the United States, such locales were called Indian Reservations, with the generally abominable conditions to be expected as the end result of a several-centuries-long government-sponsored genocidal undertaking.<br><br>Up here, conditions were at least slightly better, with a school, a firehouse, a general store, and maybe a hundred clapboard houses, all in decent enough shape. The area was neatly maintained, without the abandoned cars and paint-peeling buildings White knew were par for the course on U.S. reservations. Best of all, the Meander River racial makeup meant that White wore reverse camouflage--he was one of only four or five persons in the town without the dark red skin and flat, wide features of the Dene Tha--giving him the prime advantage of seeing pale-face trouble coming from a long ways off.<br><br>The Familiars were universally white, racial purity being one element of the breeding recipe that had been perfected over countless centuries. And, of course, the U.S. government, particularly the ironically dubbed black ops agencies, weren't exactly renowned for their Rainbow Coalition hiring practices. So, for the time being anyway, White felt--if not safe--prepared to meet any difficulty, in this tiny Canadian burg.<br><br>Of course, White's whiteness had its downside. Among this dusky population, he stuck out like a failed Manticore experiment--he wouldn't have looked any more out of place had he been that imbecilic Dog Boy or that psychotic Lizard Man. While this would make him easy for his pursuers to spot, over all he maintained a certain peace of mind knowing that anyone hunting him would likely be in the same Caucasian--or at least non-Native American--boat.<br><br>Even so, White would also be harder to spot now than half a year ago, when his picture was broadcast on every television in North America. His spiky brown hair had grown out and covered his ears, a neatly trimmed beard and mustache replacing his previously clean-shaven face, giving him a well-groomed mountain-man appearance; his piercing dark eyes remained his most identifiable feature. The parka somewhat masked his lithely muscular build; but then, he had always looked slighter and less capable than he actually was.<br><br>He thought of himself as a mild-mannered Clark Kent, who could remove his glasses, strip off his attire, and reveal the Yber-man beneath. On the other hand, he had no need for glasses, with his keen Familiar-bred eyesight, and no one had ever accused him of being mild-mannered, or of having any manners at all, when it came right down to it.<br><br>When White had first arrived here four months ago, the former NSA agent rented a small blue house once owned by a schoolteacher who had taken a post in Calgary. With its two bedrooms, a sometimes functioning TV aerial, a bathroom with perpetually cold running water, and living-room fireplace, the one-story clapboard at least kept out the chill. He had enough money to live comfortably up here, the benefits of both government service and money provided him by the Familiars to run their operations.<br><br>Working for two secret organizations over half a decade had kept a steady flow of untraceable cash running through White's hands and flowing into numerous bank accounts under as many names. The fact that the NSA didn't know about the Familiars had allowed him to work both sides of the fence. For their part, the well-funded Familiars had been in existence longer than anyone could imagine, and they had wanted White to maintain his position within the NSA. The loss of that position through the treachery of his subordinate Otto Gottlieb would definitely have angered his Familiar superiors, a good reason for White to take this extended Canadian getaway.<br><br>Eventually, he would have to approach the Familiars and make peace with them, though doing so would surely mean risking his life. His priority for these many months had been survival--to retrench and use his best weapon . . . his mind . . . to begin working out a solution, to think his way out of this seeming impasse. He had personal desires, involving his boy, but he still shared the beliefs and goals of the Familiars, and his goal was to convince them that he should be allowed a second chance.<br><br>And yet still he remained in Meander River--telling himself that he was merely allowing the Familiars to cool off, to achieve a distance from his failures that might allow him to present his case before dispassionate judges. Truth be told, though, he had come to like living up here, where just getting by was a little harder--it gave him a feeling of tranquillity, and also pride that he was not only surviving, but adapting quite well to his new surroundings. He was free of the stress of his former double life. Someday, when he and his son Ray were reunited, this might be the sort of place where they could live together.<br><br>Even White's dreaded migraine headaches--something he struggled against constantly while working for the government (of course, those assholes could give Jesus Christ migraines)--hadn't bothered him nearly as much as he'd settled into life in Meander River. Pain was something White and those of his breed had largely overcome--their pain thresholds had been bred to near extinction, the remnants remaining only to serve as the warning system nature intended. But certain physiologically driven discomfort--genetically passed along--broke down the well-bred defenses of White and his kind . . . the migraines a prime example.<br><br>Bundling up in a parka, ski mask, and boots, White prepared for the short walk to Malcolm's, a combination restaurant and bar that was the only place in town to get either a hot meal or a real drink. Cooking not being among his many skills--and not an interest he wanted to cultivate--White spent a lot of time at Malcolm's, where the hired help, as well as the owner himself, had long since recognized him as a regular.<br><br>They were a stoic, sour bunch, however, still treating him like a stranger, an outsider. Perhaps it was racial, but in any event, White had the unmistakable feeling that none of the Malcolm's crew liked him. It wasn't an uncommon response on his part; people often appeared to instinctively feel an antipathy toward him, probably because of his well-earned air of superiority.<br><br>White didn't give a good goddamn whether these savages liked him or not, another common response on his part. If he could not be with his own kind--his son, for example--Ames White was quite content with his own company. If anything, he appreciated the staff at Malcolm's for not inflicting small talk upon him--such interaction was a part of life among the mongrel humans that he had endured far too long.<br><br>Trudging down the street, White once again considered all the things that had gone wrong in the past twelve months or so, and the people who had been responsible. At the top of this ignoble list was the transgenic bitch called Max--he had missed numerous opportunities to either capture or kill the X5--specifically, X5-452--who had turned his life into a living hell. His faithless NSA partner Otto Gottlieb had not only turned on him, but ratted him out to the only enemy as dangerous as 452 herself: Eyes Only, the underground cyberterrorist.<br><br>The rebel investigative journalist--whose identity remained unknown--was always prying into matters of importance; most of this interference had been peripheral . . . annoying but never anything that could truly block White in his own sub-rosa efforts. That had all changed, however, when Eyes Only broadcast one of his trademark video hacks, the subject of which was Ames White.<br><br>For all intents and purposes, the renegade broadcast had ruined both of White's careers, tainting him not only with the NSA but the Familiars. And Eyes Only's little unscheduled "program" had even been highlighted by segments showcasing inside information courtesy of that wimp NSA underling Sage Thompson and White's own former partner, Otto.<br><br>And though this was the major setback that had sent him scurrying for his life in the anonymity of Meander Falls, even that could not compare to the loss of his son, Ray. Kidnapped by 452 and an unidentified man from the Familiar's own school, Brookridge Academy, the boy was now MIA, leaving no clues to his whereabouts. In the end, he not only had lost Ray, but his wife Wendy as well.<br><br>Of course, White had killed Wendy himself . . . a necessity, considering her treachery toward him; but that didn't negate the nagging needle of loss. His wife had been a fine companion, with many good qualities--she just hadn't known when to let things go. In the long run, though, he supposed he and Ray were better off without her--she was merely the vessel for Ray's creation and, as such, lacked the breeding he and his son shared.<br><br>The most important thing now was to find Ray. Someday, White knew, he would get his son back. But this was a search he dared not undertake until he'd made his peace with the Familiars.<br><br>And in a matter of days--and he did wish he could be with his brothers when it happened--an event would transpire that would put his people on the top of the world. He might seem more valuable to the Conclave, soon--when his expertise and knowledge of X5-452 would come in very handy . . .<br><br>Even on the best of days, as its name implied, Meander River wasn't exactly a bustling metropolis; but as White strode down the deserted street, it dawned on him that things were even more quiet than usual . . . and usual was pretty damned quiet. As snow blew through, on a moan of wind, like cold sand thrown in his face, White felt as though he were walking through a snow-covered, subzero ghost town. His pistol nestled in the usual belt holster at the small of his back, the cold steel against his spine somehow reassuring; and a second gun was snugged in his parka pocket, where he could get at it immediately. So there was no need for apprehension.<br><br>You've been in the boonies too long, he told himself.<br><br>The snow crunching beneath his boots, the frigid air carrying the not unpleasant aroma of Malcolm's beef stew, now barely a block away, White recalled the pre-Pulse homily: "Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you."<br><br>But White's newly revised version was, "Just because they're out to get you doesn't mean you have to be paranoid." He smiled at the thought--even on the run he could maintain control--and started to cross the alley that ran beside Malcolm's.<br><br>And, as he did, from the alley emanated a deep voice--unthreatening, not at all loud, and yet booming: "Fe'nos tol."<br><br>White froze.<br><br>The familiar greeting of the Familiars.<br><br>After all these months . . . they had found him. Just because you're not paranoid, he thought, doesn't mean they won't get you. It didn't matter how they'd managed it, only that they were here, that they had somehow gotten into town without his being aware. He forced out a long, slow breath, a plume of cold steam rising from his mouth as he turned to face the voice.<br><br>"Fe'nos tol," he replied.<br><br>Two men faced him, each winter-bundled in parkas much like his. They also wore full ski masks, but whether these were men he would recognize, with their faces exposed, was a moot point. Who they were wasn't as important as who they represented.</p><h2>Heavenly Highway Hymns: Shaped-Note Hymnal-Available in Blue Only</h2><p>Great condition, on inside cover is pasted the affirmation of Faith and Apostles Creed</p><p></p><h2>All the Small Poems and Fourteen More</h2><p>Including all of the author&#39;s original, illustrated &#34;small poems,&#34; a new collection features fourteen new poems with thoughtful, imaginative illustrations, and demonstrates the poet&#39;s ability to see ordinary things from an extraordinary perspective.</p><p><p><b>Valerie Worth (1933-1994)</b></p><p>Acclaimed poet Valerie Worth was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in nearby Swarthmore, where her father taught biology at Swarthmore College.

Possessed with a marvelous imagination as well as a strong flair for the dramatic, she acts the stories out, always giving herself the most exciting parts. Thus, it is natural when her teacher announces a classroom production of Peter Pan , that Grace wants to play the lead. One classmate says she can't because she's a girl and another says she can't because she's black. When a saddened Grace relates the days events to her mother and grandmother, they tell her she can be anything she wants to, if she puts her mind to it. Inspired by her family's support, her own indomitable spirit, and an excursion to a weekend ballet starring a lovely Trinidadian dancer, Grace shines during her audition, leaving no doubt in anyone's mind as to who will play Peter Pan. Gorgeous watercolor illustrations portraying a determined, talented child and her warm family enhance an excellent text and positive message of self-affirmation. Grace is an amazing girl and this is an amazing book. --Anna DeWind, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Joy of Lettering: A creative exploration of contemporary hand lettering, typography &amp; illustrated typeface</h2><p><p><b>With more than 50 tips, techniques, and lessons for creating beautiful illuminated letters and sophisticated lettering projects,<i> The Joy of Lettering</i> takes hand lettering to a whole new level.</b></p><p>Gabri Joy Kirkendall (<i>Creative Lettering &amp; Beyond</i>) and Jaclyn Escalera guide readers through a dynamic exploration of the craft, focusing on typography and illuminated letters and numbers using pencil, ink, and marker in a variety of styles and themes.

The centerpiece of the book is the daring Tex Walters shoot-out of 1923 when inmate Walters and two confederates shot and killed three prison guards, wounded a fourth, and barricaded themselves in the dining hall for four days. The National Guard was called in and the siege garnered nationwide attention as the suspenseful stand-off unfolded.

According to human genome research, there is a remarkable degree of overlap in the DNA of humans and chimpanzees. So what accounts for the rapid development of human culture throughout history and the extraordinary creative and destructive aspects of human behavior that make us so different from our primate cousins? Kellogg explores in detail five distinctive parts of human cognition. These are the executive functions of working memory; a social intelligence with &#34;mind-reading&#34; abilities; a capacity for symbolic thought and language; an inner voice that interprets conscious experiences by making causal inferences; and a means for mental time travel to past events and imagined futures. He argues that it is the interaction of these five components that results in our uniquely human mind. This is especially true for three quintessentially human endeavors-morality, spirituality, and literacy, which can be understood only in light of the whole ensemble&#39;s interactive effects. Kellogg recaps the story of the human mind and speculates on its future. How might the Internet, 24/7 television, and smart phones affect the way the mind functions?</p><p><b>Ronald T.

Twenty minutes after midnight, fourteen miles south of Rancho Mirage in the otherwise impenetrable darkness of the Anza-Borrego Desert, Jack and Krista were lit in the harsh purple glare of the lights that blossomed from Danny Trehorn&#x2019;s truck, Jack so much in love with this girl his heart beat with hers.</p><p>Trehorn gunned his engine.</p><p>&#x201c;You guys comin&#x2019; or what?&#x201d;</p><p>Krista snuggled deeper into Jack&#x2019;s arms.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s stay a little longer. Just us. Not them. I want to tell you something.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack called to his friend.</p><p>&#x201c;Ma�ana, dude. We&#x2019;re gonna hang.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We roll early, bro. See you at nine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See us at noon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pussy! We&#x2019;ll wake your ass up!&#x201d;</p><p>Trehorn dropped back into his truck, and spun a one-eighty back toward town, <i>Ride of the Valkyries</i> blaring on his sound system. Chuck Lautner and Deli Blake tucked Chuck&#x2019;s ancient Land Cruiser in tight behind Trehorn, their headlamps flashing over Jack&#x2019;s Mustang, which was parked up the old county road where the ground was more even. They had come out to show Krista a drug smuggler&#x2019;s airplane that had crashed in 1972 because Krista wanted to see it.</p><p>Jack grew colder as their tail lights receded, and the desert grew darker. A thin crescent moon and cloudy star field gave them enough light to see, but little more.</p><p>Jack said, &#x201c;Dark.&#x201d;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t answer.</p><p>Jack said, &#x201c;Cold.&#x201d;</p><p>He snuggled closer, spooning into her back, both of them staring at nothing. Jack wondered what she was seeing.</p><p>Krista had been pensive all night even though she had pushed them to come, and now her wanting to tell him something felt ominous. Jack had the sick feeling she was pregnant or dumping him. Krista was two months from graduating <i>summa cum laude</i> at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles, and had taken a job in D.C. Jack had dropped out of USC.</p><p>Jack nuzzled into her hair.</p><p>&#x201c;Are we okay?&#x201d;</p><p>She pushed away far enough to study him, then smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;There have never been two people better than us. I am totally in love with you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You had me worried.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for getting Danny to bring us out here. I don&#x2019;t think he wanted to come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long drive if you&#x2019;ve seen it a million times. He stopped coming out here in high school.&#x201d;</p><p>According to Trehorn, the twin-engine Cessna 310 had crashed while bringing in a load of coke at night during a sandstorm. A local drug dealer named Greek Cisneros cleared enough cactus and rocks to fashion a landing strip in the middle of the desert twenty miles outside Palm Springs, and used the airplane to bring cocaine and marijuana up from Mexico, almost always at night when the outline of the runway was marked by burning tubs of gasoline. On the night of the crash, the right wingtip hooked into the ground, the landing gear collapsed, and the left wing snapped off outside the left engine. Fuel pouring from the ruptured fuel tanks ignited, enveloping the airplane in flames. The engines and instruments had long ago been salvaged for parts, but the broken airframe remained where it died, rusting, corroded, and covered with generations of overlapping graffiti and spray-painted initials: LJ+DF, eat me, PSHS#1.</p><p>Krista took his hand, and tugged him toward the plane.</p><p>&#x201c;Come with me. I want to show you something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you tell me about it in the car? I&#x2019;m cold.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, not in the car. This is important.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack followed her along the fuselage to the tail, wondering what she wanted to show him about this stupid airplane, but instead she led him onto the overgrown remains of the runway. She stared into the darkness that masked the desert. Her smart, black eyes shined like jewels filled with starlight. Jack touched her hair.</p><p>&#x201c;Kris?&#x201d;</p><p>They had known each other for one year, two months, and sixteen days. They had been head-over-heels, crazy, there-and-back, inside-out, bottom-to-top in love for five months, three weeks, and eleven days. He hadn&#x2019;t told her the truth about himself until after she declared her love. If he had secrets then, she had secrets now.</p><p>Krista took his hand in both of hers, giving him the serious, all-business eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;This place is special to my family.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack had no idea what she was talking about.</p><p>&#x201c;A drug runner&#x2019;s airstrip?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This place, right here between the mountains, it&#x2019;s a place easily found by people coming from the south, for all the same reasons the drug dealers put their landing strip here. When my mother was seven, coyotes brought her up through the desert from the south. Mom and her sister and two cousins. A man with a hearse was waiting here at this airplane to drive them into town.&#x201d;</p><p>Jack said, &#x201c;No shit?&#x201d;</p><p>Krista laughed, but her laugh was unsure.</p><p>&#x201c;I never knew. She only told me a couple of weeks ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey. I&#x2019;m giving you momentous family history, and you don&#x2019;t care?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I mean that she&#x2019;s illegal&#x2014;undocumented. Who gives a shit?&#x201d;</p><p>Krista tipped back to look up at him, then suddenly grabbed his ears and kissed him.</p><p>&#x201c;Undocumented, but you don&#x2019;t have to go all PC.&#x201d;</p><p>Krista&#x2019;s mother had described a twelve-day trip on foot, in cars, and in a delivery truck where it got so hot that an old man died. The last leg of their journey had been in a covered pickup truck at night past the Salton Sea and across a sixteen-mile stretch of desert to the old crash site. The man with the hearse had driven them to a supermarket parking lot at the eastern edge of Coachella, where her uncle was waiting.</p><p>She looked south into the darkness as if she could see her mother&#x2019;s footsteps.</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be here if she hadn&#x2019;t come through this place. She wouldn&#x2019;t have met my dad. I wouldn&#x2019;t have met you. I wouldn&#x2019;t exist.&#x201d;</p><p>Krista looked up, and her face was all <i>summa-cum-laude</i> focused.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you imagine what her journey must have been like? I&#x2019;m her kid, and I can&#x2019;t even begin.&#x201d;</p><p>She was starting to say more when Jack heard a far-off squeal. He stood taller, listening, but didn&#x2019;t say anything until he heard it again.</p><p>&#x201c;You hear it?&#x201d;</p><p>Krista turned as the faint sound of a muffled engine reached them, and two lurching shapes appeared in the dim starlight. Jack studied them for a moment, and realized they were lightless trucks crawling toward them across the desert. Jack felt a stab of fear, and whispered frantically into her ear.</p><p>&#x201c;This sucks, man. Let&#x2019;s get out of here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no, no&#x2014;I want to see. Shh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They could be drug runners. We don&#x2019;t want to be here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just wait!&#x201d;</p><p>She pulled him to the far side of the airplane, where they settled into a low depression between the cactus.</p><p>A large box truck emerged from the dark like a ship appearing out of a fog. It rumbled onto the overgrown landing strip, and stopped less than thirty yards away. No brake lights flared when it stopped. Jack tried to make himself even smaller, and wished he had pulled Kris away.</p><p>A moment later, the cab creaked open, and two men climbed out. The driver walked a few yards in front of the truck, then studied a glowing handheld device. This deep in the desert, Jack thought it was probably a GPS.</p><p>While the driver studied his GPS, the passenger went to the back of the truck, and pushed the box door open with a loud clatter. The man said something in Spanish, then Jack heard soft voices as silhouette people climbed from the truck.</p><p>Jack whispered, &#x201c;What are they doing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shh. This is amazing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They gotta be illegals.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shh.&#x201d;</p><p>Krista shifted position, and Jack cringed with a fresh burst of fear. She was taking pictures with her cell phone.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop. They&#x2019;ll see us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one can see.&#x201d;</p><p>The people emerging stayed near the truck as if they were confused. So many people appeared Jack did not see how they had all fit inside. As many as thirty people stood uneasily in the brush, speaking in low murmurs with alien accents that Jack strained to identify.</p><p>&#x201c;That isn&#x2019;t Spanish. What are they speaking, Chinese?&#x201d;</p><p>Krista lowered her phone and strained to listen, too.</p><p>&#x201c;A few Spanish speakers, but most of them sound Asian. Something else, too. Is that Arabic?&#x201d;</p><p>The man who opened the truck returned to the driver, and spoke clearly in Spanish. Jack figured these two were the coyotes&#x2014;guides who were hired to sneak people illegally into the U.S. He leaned closer to Krista, who was fluent in Spanish.</p><p>&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Where in hell are they? Those bastards are supposed to be here.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>The driver mumbled something neither Jack nor Krista understood, then visibly jumped when three sets of headlights topped by roll-bar lamps snapped on a hundred yards behind the box truck, lighting the desert between in stark relief. Three off-road trucks roared forward, bouncing high on their oversized tires. The two coyotes shouted, and a scrambled chatter rose from the milling people. The driver ran into the desert, and his partner ran back to their truck. He emerged with a shotgun, and ran after his friend even as two of the incoming pickups skidded in a loose circle around the box truck, kicking up murky clouds of dust.

When Nita Morales called that morning about her missing adult daughter, she didn&#x2019;t sound afraid. She was irritated. Ms. Morales phoned because the Sunday <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine </i>published a story about me eight weeks ago, rehashing a case where I cleared an innocent man who had been convicted of multiple homicides. The magazine people came to my office, took a couple of pretty good pictures, and made me sound like a cross between Philip Marlowe and Batman. If I were Nita Morales, I would have called me, too.</p><p>Her business, Hector Sports &amp; Promotions, was on the east side of the Los Angeles River near the Sixth Street Bridge, not far from where giant radioactive ants boiled up from the sewer to be roasted by James Arness in the 1954 classic, <i>Them!</i> It was a warehouse area now, but no less dangerous. Buildings were layered with gang tags and graffiti, and signs warned employees to lock their cars. Steel bars covered windows and concertina wire lined roofs, but not to keep out the ants.</p><p>That spring morning, 8:55 A.M., a low haze filled the sky with a glare so bright I squinted behind the Wayfarers as I found the address. Hector Sports&nbsp;&amp; Promotions was in a newer building with a gated, ten-foot chain-link fence enclosing their parking lot.</p><p>A young Latin guy with thick shoulders and dull eyes came out when I stopped, as if he had been waiting.</p><p>&#x201c;You the magazine guy?&#x201d;</p><p>The magazine guy.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.

You might want to put up the top and lock it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Think it&#x2019;ll be safe?&#x201d;</p><p>That would be me, flashing the ironic smile at their overkill battlestar security.</p><p>&#x201c;For sure. They only steal clean cars.&#x201d;</p><p>That would be him, putting me in my place.</p><p>He shook his head sadly as I drove past.</p><p>&#x201c;I had an old Vette like this, I&#x2019;d show some love. I&#x2019;d pop those dents, for sure.&#x201d;</p><p>That would be him, rubbing it in. My Jamaica yellow 1966 Corvette Stingray convertible is a classic. It&#x2019;s also dirty.</p><p>He locked the parking gate behind us, told me he was Nita Morales&#x2019;s assistant, and led me inside. We passed through an outer office with a counter for customers, and a man and woman at separate desks. The man and woman both looked over, and the man held up the Sunday magazine issue with my story. Embarrassing.</p><p>We passed through a door onto the shop floor where fifteen or twenty people were operating machines that sewed logos on baseball caps and photo-inked mugs. Nita Morales had a glass office on the far side of the shop where she could see the floor and everything happening there.

What really struck me in reading <i>Beyond These Walls</i> was that Tony Platt had very seriously and carefully considered the contributions of social movements&#x2015;feminist, queer, disability, and labor.&#x201d; &#x2015;Angela Davis </b><br><b></b> <br><i>Beyond These Walls</i> is an ambitious and far-ranging exploration that tracks the legacy of crime and imprisonment in the United States, from the historical roots of the American criminal justice system to our modern state of over-incarceration, and offers a bold vision for a new future. Author Tony Platt, a recognized authority in the field of criminal justice, challenges the way we think about how and why millions of people are tracked, arrested, incarcerated, catalogued, and regulated in the United States. </p><p><i>Beyond These Walls</i> traces the disturbing history of punishment and social control, revealing how the criminal justice system attempts to enforce and justify inequalities associated with class, race, gender, and sexuality. Prisons and police departments are central to this process, but other institutions &#x2013; from immigration and welfare to educational and public health agencies &#x2013; are equally complicit. </p><p>Platt argues that international and national politics shape perceptions of danger and determine the policies of local criminal justice agencies, while private policing and global corporations are deeply and undemocratically involved in the business of homeland security. </p><p>Finally, <i>Beyond These Walls</i> demonstrates why efforts to reform criminal justice agencies have often expanded rather than contracted the net of social control. Drawing upon a long tradition of popular resistance, Platt concludes with a strategic vision of what it will take to achieve justice for all in this era of authoritarian disorder.</p></p><p>TONY PLATT is a Distinguished Affiliated Scholar at the Center for the Study of Law &amp; Society, University of California, Berkeley. The author of numerous books dealing with issues of criminal justice, race, inequality, and social justice in American history, including<i> Beyond These Walls: Rethinking Crime and Punishment in the United States</i>, he previously taught at the University of Chicago, Berkeley, and California state universities. Platt&#x2019;s experience as a political activist and public intellectual informs his research and publications. He lives in Berkeley, CA.<p>"Tony Platt, a professor at University of California Berkeley's Center for the Study of Law &amp; Society, takes a deep dive into the state of incarceration in our country, looking at the historic barriers to criminal justice and prison reform and correlating them to today. "&#x2015;Seth Ferranti, <i>Vice</i></p><br><p>"In a brilliant resumption of his earlier engagement with institutions of state violence, Tony Platt offers us expansive and historically-rich ways of understanding policing and incarceration that also acknowledge and incorporate insights associated with feminism, queer movements, labor history, and anti-racism in their broadest formulations. He urges us to recognize why most efforts to reform these institutions have inevitably strengthened them and have rendered their repressive dimensions even more permanent."<br>&#x2015;Angela Y. Davis, Distinguished Professor Emerita, University of California, Santa Cruz </p><p>"The American criminal justice system is an international scandal, both in its scale and its brutality. While these crimes have escalated since Reagan, they are rooted in a much broader range of 'social control institutions,' matters investigated with penetrating insight and historical depth in this powerful study, which does not limit itself to critical analysis but proceeds on to consideration of serious remedies." &#x2015; Noam Chomsky, Professor Emeritus, MIT; author of more than 100 books; and recipient of Sean McBride Peace Prize (2017)</p><p>"Warning: this is a book that will tug at your conscience long after you put it down. Platt, a renowned criminologist, has spent a lifetime fighting against the cruelty and injustice that hides behind black robes and police badges. Superbly written, this is the most accurate and up-to-date overview of 'carceral' America. He argues that while rates of incarceration may have peaked, the criminalization of poverty, race and sexual difference has accelerated since the election of Donald Trump opened the doors of hell."&#x2015;Mike Davis, MacArthur Fellow (1998), recipient of Lannan Literary Foundation award for non-fiction (2007), author of more than twenty books</p><p>"For anyone seeking to understand this nation&#x2019;s staggeringly inhumane apparatus of policing, caging, and control, Tony Platt&#x2019;s <i>Beyond These Walls</i> is a sobering must read. Platt remains one of our country&#x2019;s most important voices on crime and punishment. His new book is vital as we reckon with the depth of our current carceral crisis and begin building a very different and more just future."</p><p>&#x2015;Heather Ann Thompson, Pulitzer Prize winning author of <i>Blood In The Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and its Legacy</i></p><p>&#x201c;With strong emphasis on supporting statistics and studies, Platt amasses a wealth of sobering and illuminating details to reach an understanding of how past cultural attitudes influence contemporary incarceration methods.

Privately, Fra Giovanni of Fiesole still thought of himself as Guidolino, the name he had left behind in the world when he came to the cloister. He was in the vegetable garden gathering onions, which was his job, since in abandoning the world he hadn&#x2019;t wanted to abandon the vocation of his father, Pietro, who was a vegetable gardener, and in the garden at San Marco he grew tomatoes, courgettes and onions. The onions were the red kind, with big heads, very sweet after you&#x2019;d soaked them for an hour, though they made you cry a fair bit when you handled them. He was putting them in his frock gathered to form an apron, when he heard a voice calling: Guidolino. He raised his eyes and saw the bird. He saw it through onion tears filling his eyes and so stood gazing at it for a few moments, for the shape was magnified and distorted by his tears as though through a bizarre lens; he blinked his eyes to dry the lashes, then looked again.</p><h2>Red Noses</h2><p>While the Black Death fills fourteenth-century Europe with fear, Father Flote leads a traveling band of comedians in hopes of offering redemption through laughter</p><p></p><h2>Changeling (1) (Order of Darkness)</h2><p><b>Dark myths, medieval secrets, intrigue, and romance populate the pages of the first-ever teen series from #1 bestselling author of <i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i>.<i></i></b><br><br>Italy, 1453.

The young man scrambled for the dagger under his pillow, stumbling to his bare feet on the icy floor of the stone cell. He had been dreaming of his parents, of his old home, and he gritted his teeth against the usual wrench of longing for everything he had lost: the farmhouse, his mother, the old life.<br> <br>The thunderous banging sounded again, and he held the dagger behind his back as he unbolted the door and cautiously opened it a crack. A dark-hooded figure stood outside, flanked by two heavyset men, each carrying a burning torch. One of them raised his torch so the light fell on the slight dark-haired youth, naked to the waist, wearing only breeches, his hazel eyes blinking under a fringe of dark hair. He was about seventeen, with a face as sweet as a boy, but with the body of a young man forged by hard work.<br> <br>&#x201c;Luca Vero?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are to come with me.&#x201d;<br> <br>They saw him hesitate. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a fool. There are three of us and only one of you, and the dagger you&#x2019;re hiding behind your back won&#x2019;t stop us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an order,&#x201d; the other man said roughly. &#x201c;Not a request. And you are sworn to obedience.&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca had sworn obedience to his monastery, not to these strangers, but he had been expelled from there, and now it seemed he must obey anyone who shouted a command. He turned to the bed, sat to pull on his boots, slipping the dagger into a scabbard hidden inside the soft leather, pulled on a linen shirt and then threw his ragged woolen cape around his shoulders.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; he asked, coming unwillingly to the door.<br> <br>The man made no answer, but simply turned and led the way as the two guards waited in the corridor for Luca to come out of his cell and follow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you taking me?&#x201d;<br> <br>The two guards fell in behind him without answering. Luca wanted to ask if he was under arrest, if he was being marched to a summary execution, but he did not dare. He was fearful of the very question; he acknowledged to himself that he was terrified of the answer. He could feel himself sweating with fear under his woolen cape, though the air was icy and the stone walls were cold and damp.<br> <br>He knew that he was in the most serious trouble of his young life. Only yesterday four dark-hooded men had taken him from his monastery and brought him here, to this prison, without a word of explanation. He did not know where he was or who was holding him. He did not know what charge he might face. He did not know what the punishment might be. He did not know if he was going to be beaten, tortured or killed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I insist on seeing a priest, I wish to confess . . .&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>They paid no attention to him at all, but pressed him on, down the narrow stone-flagged gallery. It was silent, with the closed doors of cells on either side. He could not tell if it was a prison or a monastery, it was so cold and quiet. It was just after midnight, and the place was in darkness and utterly still. Luca&#x2019;s guides made no noise as they walked along the gallery, down the stone steps, through a great hall and then down a little spiral staircase into a darkness that grew more and more black as the air grew more and more cold.<br> <br>&#x201c;I demand to know where you are taking me,&#x201d; Luca insisted, but his voice shook with fear.<br> <br>No one answered him, but the guard behind him closed up a little.<br> <br>At the bottom of the steps, Luca could just see a small arched doorway and a heavy wooden door. The leading man opened it with a key from his pocket and gestured that Luca should go through. When he hesitated, the guard behind him simply moved closer until the menacing bulk of his body pressed Luca onward.<br> <br>&#x201c;I insist . . .&#x201d; Luca breathed.<br> <br>A hard shove thrust him through the doorway, and he gasped as he found himself flung to the very edge of a high, narrow quay, a boat rocking in the river a long way below, the far bank a dark blur in the distance. Luca flinched back from the brink. He had a sudden dizzying sense that they would be as willing to throw him over, onto the rocks below, as to take him down the steep stairs to the boat.<br> <br>The first man went light-footed down the wet steps, stepped into the boat and said one word to the boatman who stood in the stern, holding the vessel against the current with the deft movements of a single oar. Then he looked back up to the handsome white-faced young man.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come,&#x201d; he ordered.<br> <br>Luca could do nothing else. He followed the man down the greasy steps, clambered into the boat and seated himself in the prow. The boatman did not wait for the guards but turned his craft into the middle of the river and let the current sweep them around the city wall. Luca glanced down into the dark water. If he were to fling himself over the side of the boat, he would be swept downstream&#x2014;he might be able to swim with the current and make it to the other side and get away. But the water was flowing so fast he thought he was more likely to drown, if they did not come after him in the boat and knock him senseless with the oar.<br> <br>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; he said, trying for dignity. &#x201c;May I ask you now where we are going?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll know soon enough,&#x201d; came the terse reply. The river ran like a wide moat around the tall walls of the city of Rome. The boatman kept the little craft close to the lee of the walls, hidden from the sentries above; then Luca saw ahead of them the looming shape of a stone bridge and, just before it, a grille set in an arched stone doorway of the wall. As the boat nosed inward, the grille slipped noiselessly up and, with one practiced push of the oar, they shot inside, into a torch-lit cellar.<br> <br>With a deep lurch of fear, Luca wished that he had taken his chance with the river. There were half a dozen grim-faced men waiting for him, and as the boatman held a well-worn ring on the wall to steady the craft, they reached down and hauled Luca out of the boat, to push him down a narrow corridor. Luca felt, rather than saw, thick stone walls on either side, smooth wooden floorboards underfoot; heard his own breathing, ragged with fear; then they paused before a heavy wooden door, struck it with a single knock and waited.<br> <br>A voice from inside the room said, &#x201c;Come!&#x201d; and the guard swung the door open and thrust Luca inside. Luca stood, heart pounding, blinking at the sudden brightness of dozens of wax candles, and heard the door close silently behind him.<br> <br>A solitary man was sitting at a table, papers before him. He wore a robe of rich velvet in so dark a blue that it appeared almost black, the hood completely concealing his face from Luca, who stood before the table and swallowed down his fear. Whatever happened, he decided, he was not going to beg for his life. Somehow, he would find the courage to face whatever was coming. He would not shame himself, nor his tough stoic father, by whimpering like a girl.<br> <br>&#x201c;You will be wondering why you are here, where you are, and who I am,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;I will tell you these things. But, first, you must answer me everything that I ask. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;You must not lie to me. Your life hangs in the balance here, and you cannot guess what answers I would prefer. Be sure to tell the truth: you would be a fool to die for a lie.&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca tried to nod but found he was shaking.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are Luca Vero, a novice priest at the monastery of St. Xavier, having joined the monastery when you were a boy of eleven? You have been an orphan for the last three years, since your parents died when you were fourteen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My parents disappeared,&#x201d; Luca said. He cleared his tight throat. &#x201c;They may not be dead. They were captured by an Ottoman raid, but nobody saw them killed. Nobody knows where they are now, but they may very well be alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Inquisitor made a minute note on a piece of paper before him. Luca watched the tip of the black feather as the quill moved across the page. &#x201c;You hope,&#x201d; the man said briefly. &#x201c;You hope that they are alive and will come back to you.&#x201d; He spoke as if hope was the greatest folly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Raised by the brothers, sworn to join their holy order, yet you went to your confessor, and then to the abbot, and told them that the relic that they keep at the monastery, a nail from the true cross, was a fake.&#x201d;<br> <br>The monotone voice was accusation enough. Luca knew this was a citation of his heresy. He knew also that the only punishment for heresy was death.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you say the relic was a fake?&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca looked down at his boots, at the dark wooden floor, at the heavy table, at the lime-washed walls&#x2014;anywhere but at the shadowy face of the softly spoken questioner. &#x201c;I will beg the abbot&#x2019;s pardon and do penance,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean heresy. Before God, I am no heretic. I meant no wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I shall be the judge if you are a heretic, and I have seen younger men than you, who have done and said less than you, crying on the rack for mercy as their joints pop from their sockets. I have heard better men than you begging for the stake, longing for death as their only release from pain.&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca shook his head at the thought of the Inquisition, which could order this fate for him and see it done, and think it to the glory of God. He dared to say nothing more.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you say the relic was a fake?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did not mean . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is a piece of a nail about three inches long, and a quarter of an inch wide,&#x201d; Luca said unwillingly. &#x201c;You can see it, though it is now mounted in gold and covered with jewels. But you can still see the size of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Inquisitor nodded. &#x201c;So?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The abbey of St. Peter has a nail from the true cross. So does the abbey of St. Joseph. I looked in the monastery library to see if there were any others, and there are about four hundred nails in Italy alone, more in France, more in Spain, more in England.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man waited in unsympathetic silence.<br> <br>&#x201c;I calculated the likely size of the nails,&#x201d; Luca said miserably. &#x201c;I calculated the number of pieces that they might have been broken into. It didn&#x2019;t add up. There are far too many relics for them all to come from one crucifixion. The Bible says a nail in each palm and one through the feet. That&#x2019;s only three nails.&#x201d; Luca glanced at the dark face of his interrogator. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not blasphemy to say this, I don&#x2019;t think. The Bible itself says it clearly. Then, in addition, if you count the nails used in building the cross, there would be four at the central joint to hold the cross bar. That makes seven original nails. Only seven. Say each nail is about five inches long. That&#x2019;s about thirty-five inches of nails used in the true cross. But there are thousands of relics. That&#x2019;s not to say whether any nail or any fragment is genuine or not. It&#x2019;s not for me to judge. But I can&#x2019;t help but see that there are just too many nails for them all to come from one cross.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still the man said nothing.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s numbers,&#x201d; Luca said helplessly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s how I think. I think about numbers&#x2014;they interest me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You took it upon yourself to study this? And you took it upon yourself to decide that there are too many nails in churches around the world for them all to be true, for them all to come from the sacred cross?&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca dropped to his knees, knowing himself to be guilty. &#x201c;I meant no wrong,&#x201d; he whispered upward at the shadowy figure. &#x201c;I just started wondering, and then I made the calculations, and then the abbot found my paper where I had written the calculations and&#x2014;&#x201d; He broke off.<br> <br>&#x201c;The abbot, quite rightly, accused you of heresy and forbidden studies, misquoting the Bible for your own purposes, reading without guidance, showing independence of thought, studying without permission, at the wrong time, studying forbidden books . . .&#x201d; the man continued, reading from the list. He looked at Luca. &#x201c;Thinking for yourself. That&#x2019;s the worst of it, isn&#x2019;t it? You were sworn into an order with certain established beliefs, and then you started thinking for yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca nodded. &#x201c;I am sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The priesthood does not need men who think for themselves.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Luca said, very low.<br> <br>&#x201c;You made a vow of obedience&#x2014;that is a vow not to think for yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca bowed his head, waiting to hear his sentence.<br> <br>The flame of the candles bobbed as somewhere outside a door opened and a cold draft blew through the rooms.<br> <br>&#x201c;Always thought like this? With numbers?&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Any friends in the monastery? Have you discussed this with anyone?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shook his head. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t discuss this.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man looked at his notes. &#x201c;You have a companion called Freize?&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca smiled for the first time. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just the kitchen boy at the monastery,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;He took a liking to me as soon as I arrived, when I was just eleven. He was only twelve or thirteen himself. He made up his mind that I was too thin; he said I wouldn&#x2019;t last the winter. He kept bringing me extra food. He&#x2019;s just the spit lad, really.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You have no brother or sister?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am alone in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You miss your parents?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are lonely?&#x201d; The way he said it sounded like yet another accusation.<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose so. I feel very alone, if that is the same thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man rested the black feather of the quill against his lips in thought. &#x201c;Your parents . . .&#x201d; He returned to the first question of the interrogation. &#x201c;They were quite old when you were born?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Luca said, surprised. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;People talked at the time, I understand. That such an old couple should suddenly give birth to a son, and such a handsome son, who grew to be such an exceptionally clever boy?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a small village,&#x201d; Luca said defensively. &#x201c;People have nothing to do but gossip.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But clearly, you are handsome. Clearly, you are clever. And yet they did not brag about you or show you off. They kept you quietly at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We were close,&#x201d; Luca replied. &#x201c;We were a close, small family. We troubled nobody else, we lived quietly, the three of us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why did they give you to the Church? Was it that they thought you would be safer inside the Church? That you were specially gifted? That you needed the Church&#x2019;s protection?&#x201d;<br> <br>Luca, still on his knees, shuffled in discomfort. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I was a child: I was only eleven. I don&#x2019;t know what they were thinking.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Inquisitor waited.<br> <br>&#x201c;They wanted me to have the education of a priest,&#x201d; he said eventually. &#x201c;My father&#x2014;&#x201d; He paused at the thought of his beloved father, of his gray hair and his hard grip, of his tenderness to his funny, quirky little son. &#x201c;My father was very proud that I learned to read, that I taught myself about numbers. He couldn&#x2019;t write or read himself; he thought it was a great talent. Then when some gypsies came through the village, I learned their language.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man made a note. &#x201c;You can speak languages?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;People remarked that I learned to speak Romany in a day. My father thought that I had a gift, a God-given gift. It&#x2019;s not so uncommon,&#x201d; he tried to explain. &#x201c;Freize, the spit boy, is good with animals; he can do anything with horses, he can ride anything. My father thought that I had a gift like that, only for studying. He wanted me to be more than a farmer. He wanted me to do better.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Inquisitor sat back in his chair, as if he was weary of listening, as if he had heard more than enough. &#x201c;You c...</p><h2>Mo</h2><p>A few spine lines.

She gives concrete details on what constitutes abuse and shatters the myths surrounding double standards (e.g., actor Don Johnson being seduced by a female babysitter when he was 12 constitutes abuse, yet this "older woman on younger boy" style of abuse is sometimes written off). In addition to identifying the many types of abuse, Maltz demonstrates how abuse may get buried in a victim's unconscious mind and subsequently cause sexual dysfunction. She carefully deconstructs the common negative sexuality that often acts as a defense mechanism, and attempts to replace it with a healthy, positive approach to sex. Although her book is not a substitute for therapy, it can help victims of sexual abuse along the road to healing.

Rapp, MD is a board-certified environmental medical specialist and pediatric allergist. She is the New York Times best-selling author of &#34;Is This Your Child?&#34;.</p><h2>My Extraordinary Ordinary Life</h2><p>In her delightful and moving memoir, Sissy Spacek writes about her idyllic, barefoot childhood in a small East Texas town, with the clarity and wisdom that comes from never losing sight of her roots. Descended from industrious Czech immigrants and threadbare southern gentility, she grew up a tomboy, tagging along with two older brothers and absorbing grace and grit from her remarkable parents, who taught her that she could do anything. She also learned fearlessness in the wake of a family tragedy, the grief propelling her "like rocket fuel" to follow her dreams of becoming a performer.<br><br> With a keen sense of humor and a big-hearted voice, she describes how she arrived in New York City one star-struck summer as a seventeen-year-old carrying a suitcase and two guitars; and how she built a career that has spanned four decades with films such as <em>Carrie</em>, <em>Coal Miner's Daughter</em>, <em>3 Women</em>, and <em>The Help</em>. She details working with some of the great directors of our time, including Terrence Malick, Robert Altman, David Lynch, and Brian De Palma-who thought of her as a no-talent set decorator until he cast her as the lead in Carrie. She also reveals why, at the height of her fame, she and her family moved away from Los Angeles to a farm in rural Virginia. <br><br> Whether she's describing the terrors and joys of raising two talented, independent daughters, taking readers behind the scenes on Oscar night, or meditating on the thrill of watching a pair of otters frolicking in her pond, Sissy Spacek's memoir is poignant and laugh-out-loud funny, plainspoken and utterly honest. <em>My Extraordinary Ordinary Life</em> is about what matters most: the exquisite worth of ordinary things, the simple pleasures of home and family, and the honest job of being right with the world. "If I get hit by a truck tomorrow," she writes, "I want to know I've returned my neighbor's cake pan."</p><p>Sissy Spacek was raised in Quitman, Texas, the daughter of an agriculturalist and a homemaker. From her Oscar-nominated performance in <em>Carrie</em>, based on Stephen King's book, to her Academy-Award-winning portrayal of country singer Loretta Lynn in <em>Coal Miner's Daughter</em>, in which she sang all of Lynn's songs and earned a Grammy nomination, her acclaimed guest role on HBO's <em>Big Love</em>, and her uproarious turn in <em>The Help</em>, she has enjoyed an enduring career in movies and television. She lives in Virginia with her husband, the production designer, Jack Fisk, six dogs, and one cat who thinks he's a dog."<em>My Extraordinary Ordinary Life</em> is the book version of Sissy: warm, heartfelt, and very real. Perhaps most remarkable is that Sissy's life--from the ordinary experiences of growing up in and raising a close-knit family to the extraordinary thrills of starring in some of the most iconic roles in Hollywood--unfolds as gracefully on the page as it does on the big screen and, as all of her readers will soon learn, in everyday life."--<b><i>Kathryn Stockett, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Help</em></i></b><br><br>"<em>My Extraordinary Ordinary Life</em> describes a remarkable woman's journey from a baton-twirling East Texas gal to an Academy-Award winning star.

Pershing, and how the lessons it learned during the Great War helped it to fight World War II. Fax makes some startling judgments, on the role of future Army Chief-of-Staff, Colonel George C. Marshall; whether the Montfaucon battle-had it followed the plan-could have shortened the war; and if Pershing was justified in ordering his troops to attack right up to the moment of the Armistice. </p><p>Drawing upon original documents, including orders, field messages, and the letters and memoirs of the soldiers themselves, some of which have never been used before, Fax tells the engrossing story of the 79th Division's bloody involvement in the final months of World War I.</p></p><p><b>Gene Fax </b>has written over two hundred research reports, policy papers, and proposals.

Davenport, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"Superb account of the final, violent throes of World War I . . . compelling account of the hastily assembled, lightly trained American Expeditionary Forces." - Tony Perry, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>"Based on meticulous research Gene Fax&#x2019;s fascinating account of the poorly trained 79th Division in the Meuse-Argonne offensive tells us much about how inexperience, poor communications and inadequate support compelled that division&#x2019;s courageous soldiers to fight 'with their bare hands.' Fax tells the amazing story of how the American Expeditionary Force and the 79th Division overcame many errors and false ideas and paid a high price learning how to fight effectively." - Brigadier General (ret.) Robert A. Doughty</p><p>"The men of the AEF&#x2019;s 79th Division were warriors for the working day: civilians in uniform. Their training was minimal, their cohesion limited, their tactics defying four years of Western Front experience. Yet the 79th&#x2019;s first assignment was to take one of the best-defended position in the Argonne Forest. It became a compound disaster. But the division&#x2019;s subsequent recovery is a case study in American soldiers&#x2019; often-demonstrated high learning curve and the AEF&#x2019;s contribution to victory in 1918.

I was standing in the St. George's car park, getting books out of the back of my car, when she came through the gates on a bicycle--an old-fashioned, butcher-boy model with a basket in the front. Her hair was arranged in one of those artfully dishevelled up-dos: a lot of stray tendrils framing the jaw, and something like a chopstick piercing a rough bun at the back. It was the sort of hairstyle that film actresses wear when they're playing sexy lady doctors. I can't recall exactly what she had on. Sheba's outfits tend to be very complicated--lots of floaty layers. I know she was wearing purple shoes. And there was definitely a long skirt involved, because I remember thinking that it was in imminent danger of becoming entangled in her spokes. When she dismounted--with a lithe, rather irritating little skip--I saw that the skirt was made of some diaphanous material. <i>Fey</i> was the word that swam into my mind. <i>Fey person,</i> I thought. Then I locked my car and walked away.My formal introduction to Sheba took place later the same day when Ted Mawson, the deputy head, brought her into the staff room at afternoon break for a "meet and greet." Afternoonbreak is not a good time to meet schoolteachers. If you were to plot a graph of a teacher's spirits throughout the school day, afternoon break would be represented by the lowest valley. The air in the staff room has a trapped, stagnant quality. The chirpy claptrap of the early morning has died away, and those staff members who are not milling about, checking their timetables and so on, sprawl in lugubrious silence. (To be fair, the sprawling is as much a tribute to the shoddy construction of the staff room's three elderly foam sofas as an expression of the teachers' low morale.) Some of the teachers stare, slack-shouldered, into space. Some of them read--the arts and media pages of the liberal newspapers mainly, or paperback editions of the lower sort of fiction-the draw being not so much the content as the shield against having to converse with their colleagues. A great many chocolate bars and instant noodles in plastic pots are consumed.On the day of Sheba's arrival, the staff room was slightly more crowded than usual, owing to the heating being on the blink in Old Hall. (In addition to its three modern structures--the Gym, the Arts Centre, and the Science Block--the St. George's site includes two rather decrepit redbrick buildings, Old Hall and Middle Hall, which date back to the school's original, Victorian incarnation as an orphanage.) That afternoon, several teachers who might otherwise have remained skulking in their Old Hall classrooms during break had been driven to seek refuge in the staff room, where the radiators were still operative. I was off in a far corner when Mawson ushered Sheba in, so I was able to watch their slow progress around the room for several minutes before having to mould my face into the appropriate smile.Sheba's hair had become more chaotic since the morning. The loose tendrils had graduated to hanks and, where it was meant to be smooth and pulled back, tiny, fuzzy sprigs had reared up, creating a sort of corona around her scalp. She was a very thin woman, I saw now. As she bent to shake the hands of seated staff members, her body seemed to fold in half at the waist like a piece of paper. "Our new pottery teacher!" Mr. Mawson was bellowing with his customary chilling good spirits, as he and Sheba loomed over Antonia Robinson, one of our Eng. lit women. Sheba smiled and patted shyly at her hair.<i>Pottery.</i> I repeated the word quietly to myself. It was too perfect : I pictured her, the dreamy maiden poised at her wheel, massaging tastefully mottled milk jugs into being.She was gesturing at the windows. "Why are all the curtains drawn?" I heard her ask. Ted Mawson rubbed his hands, nervously."Oh," Antonia said, "so the kids can't look in at us and make faces."Bill Rumer, the head of chemistry, who was sitting next to Antonia on one of the foam sofas, snorted loudly at this. "Actually, Antonia," he said, "it's so we can't look out at <i>them.</i> So they can smash each other up--do their raping and pillaging--and we're not required to intervene."Antonia laughed and made a scandalised face.A lot of teachers at St. George's go in for this sort of posturing cynicism about the pupils, but Bill is the chief offender. He is a rather ghastly character, I'm afraid--the sort of man who is always sitting with his legs aggressively akimbo, offering a clearer silhouette of his untidy crotch than is strictly decent. One of the more insufferable things about him is that heimagines himself tremendously naughty and shocking--a delusion in which women like Antonia are all too eager to conspire."Oh, <i>Bill,"</i> Antonia said now, pressing her skirt against her thighs."Don't worry," Bill said to Sheba, "you'll get used to the gloom." He smiled at her magnanimously--the grandee allowing her into the little enclosure of his bonhomie. Then, as his eyes swept over her, I saw his smile waver for a moment.Women observing other women tend to be engrossed by the details--the bodily minutiae, the clothing particulars. We get so caught up in the lone dimple, the excessive ears, the missing button, that we often lag behind men in organising the individual features into an overall impression. I mention this by way of explaining why it was only now, as I watched Bill, that the fact of Sheba's beauty occurred to me. Of course, I thought. She's very good looking. Sheba, who had been smiling fixedly throughout Bill and Antonia's droll exchange, made another nervous adjustment to her hair. As she raised her long, thin arms to fuss with the chopstick hair ornament, her torso lengthened and her chest was thrust forward slightly. She had a dancer's bosom. Two firm little patties riding the raft of her ribs. Bill's eyes widened. Antonia's eyes narrowed.Sheba and Mawson continued on their journey around the room. The change that took place in the teachers' faces as they set eyes on Sheba confirmed my appraisal of Bill's appraisal. The men beamed and ogled. The women shrank slightly and turned sullen. The one exception was Elaine Clifford, a St. George's alumnus who teaches lower school biology. Assuming what is her characteristic stance of unearned intimacy, Elaine stood very close to Sheba and began to blast her with impudent chatter. They were only a few feet away from me now. After amoment, Mawson turned and beckoned to me. "Barbara!" he shouted, cutting off Elaine in midstream. "Do come and meet Sheba Hart."I stepped over and joined the group."Sheba is going to be teaching pottery," Mawson said. "As you know, we've been waiting a long time to replace Mrs. Sipwitch. We feel tremendously lucky and pleased to have got her."In response to these words, a small, precise circle of scarlet appeared on each of Sheba's cheeks."This is Barbara Covett," Mawson went on. "She's one of our stalwarts. If Barbara ever left us, I'm afraid St. George's would collapse."Sheba looked at me carefully. She was about thirty-five, I estimated. (She was actually forty, about to be forty-one.) The hand that she held out to be shaken was large and red and somewhat coarse to the touch. "How nice to be so needed," she said, smiling. It was difficult to distinguish her tone, but it seemed to me that it contained a note of genuine sympathy--as if she understood how maddening it might be to be patronised by Mawson."Sheba--is that as in Queen of?" I asked."No, as in Bathsheba.""Oh. Were your parents thinking of the Bible or of Hardy?"She smiled. "I'm not sure. I think they just liked the name.""If there's anything you need to know about anything concerning this place, Sheba," Mawson continued, "you must ask Barbara. She's the St. George's expert.""Oh, smashing. I'll remember that," Sheba said.People from the privileged orders are always described as having plums in their mouths, but that wasn't what came to mind when I heard Sheba speak. On the contrary, she soundedas if her mouth were very empty and clean--as if she'd never had a filling."Oh! Love your earrings!" Elaine said now. She reached out, like a monkey, to finger Sheba's ears and, as she raised her arms, I caught a glimpse of her armpits, which were violently pink, as if inflamed, and speckled with black stubble. I do hate it when women don't keep their personal grooming up to scratch. Better the full, bushy Frenchwoman's growth than that squalid sprinkling of iron filings. "They're so pretty!" Elaine said of the earrings. "Where d'you get 'em?"Sandy Pabblem, the headmaster, is very keen on having former pupils like Elaine on staff. He imagines it reflects well on the school that they should wish to return and "give something back." But the truth is, St. George's alumni make exceptionally poor teachers. It's not so much that they don't know anything about anything. (Which they don't.) Or even that they are complacent about their ignorance. (I once heard Elaine blithely identifying Boris Yeltsin as "the Russian one who doesn't have a thingy on his head.") The real issue is one of personality. Invariably, pupils who come back to teach at St. George's are emotionally suspect characters--people who have surmised that the world out there is a frightening place and who have responded by simply staying put. They'll never have to try going home again because they're never going to leave. I have a vision sometimes of the pupils of these ex-pupils, deciding to become St. George's teachers themselves--and these ex-pupils of ex-pupils producing more ex-pupils, who return to St. George's as teachers, and so on. It would take only a couple of generations for the school to become entirely populated by dolts.I took the opportunity, while Sheba was explaining her jewellery, to examine her face more closely. The earrings <i>were</i> beautiful,as it happened: delicate little things made of gold and seed pearls. Her face was longish and thin, her nose ever so slightly crooked at the tip. And her eyes--no, not so much the eyes as the eyelids--were prodigious: great beige canopies fringed with dense lash. Like that spiky tiara that the Statue of Liberty wears."This is Sheba's first teaching post," Ted said, when Elaine had stopped talking for a moment."Well, it'll certainly be a baptism by fire," I remarked.Ted laughed with excessive heartiness and then abruptly stopped. "Okay," he said, glancing at his watch, "we ought to get on, Sheba. Let me introduce you to Malcolm Plummer ..."Elaine and I stood watching for a moment, as Sheba and Mawson moved off. "She's sweet, isn't she?" Elaine said.I smiled. "No, I wouldn't have said sweet."Elaine made a clicking noise with her tongue to indicate her affront. "Well, I think she's nice," she muttered.During her first couple of weeks at school, Sheba kept very much to herself. At break times, she often stayed in her pottery studio. When she did come into the staff room, she usually stood alone at one of the windows, peeking round the curtains at the playground outside. She was perfectly pleasant to her colleagues, which is to say she exchanged all the standard, weatherbased pleasantries. But she did not automatically gravitate to another female teacher and start swapping autobiographies. Or put her name down to join the St. George's contingent on the next march against government spending cuts. Or contribute to sarcastic group discussions about the headmaster. Her resistance to all the usual initiation rituals aroused a certain amount of suspicion among the other teachers. The women tended to the opinion that Sheba was "stuck up," while the men favouredthe theory that she was "cold." Bill Rumer, widely acknowledged as the staff expert on such matters, observed on more than one occasion that "there was nothing wrong with her that a good boning wouldn't cure."I took Sheba's failure to forge an instantaneous friendship as an encouraging sign. In my experience, newcomers--particularly female ones--are far too eager to pin their colours to the mast of any staff room coterie that will have them. Jennifer Dodd, who used to be my closest friend at the school, spent her first three weeks at St. George's buried in the welcoming bosoms of Mary Horsely and Diane Nebbins. Mary and Diane are two hippies from the maths department. They both carry packets of "women's tea" in their handbags and use jagged lumps of rock crystal in lieu of antiperspirant. They were entirely ill-suited--temperament-wise, humour-wise, worldview-wise--to be Jennifer's friends. But they happened to get to her first, and Jennifer was so grateful for someone being nice to her that she cheerfully undertook to ignore their soy milk mumbo jumbo. I daresay she would have plighted her troth to a Moonie during her first week at St. George's, if the Moonie had been quick enough off the mark.Sheba displayed no such new girl jitters and, for this, I admired her. She did not exempt me from her general aloofness. Owing to my seniority at St. George's and the fact that I am more formal in manner than most of my colleagues, I am used to being treated with a certain deference. But Sheba seemed to be oblivious of my status. There was little indication, for a long time, that she really saw me at all. Yet, in spite of this, I found myself possessed by a strange certainty that we would one day be friends.Early on, we made a few tentative approaches to one another. Somewhere in her second week, Sheba greeted me in the corridor. (She used "Hello," I was pleased to note, as opposed to the awful, Mid-Atlantic "Hiya" that so many of the staff favour.) And another time, walking from the Arts Centre after an assembly, we shared some brief, rueful comments about the choral performance that had just taken place. My feelings of connection to Sheba did not depend upon these minute exchanges, however. The bond that I sensed, even at that stage, went far beyond anything that might have been expressed in quotidian chitchat. It was an intuited kinship. An unspoken understanding. Does it sound too dramatic to call it spiritual recognition? Owing to our mutual reserve, I understood that it would take time for us to form a friendship. But when we did, I had no doubt that it would prove to be one of uncommon intimacy and trust--a relationship <i>de chaleur,</i> as the French say.In the meantime, I watched from afar and listened with interest to the gossip that circulated about her in the staff room. For most of the staff, Sheba's dignified self-containment acted as a sort of force field, repelling the usual impertinent enquiries about home life and political allegiance. But elegance loses its power in the presence of the properly stupid, and there were a few who were not deterred. From time to time, I would spot certain staff members zooming in on Sheba in the car park or playground, stunning her into submission with their vulgar curiosity. They never achieved the immediate intimacy that they were seeking. But they usually managed to extract some piece of information as a consolation prize. It was from these eager little fishwives that the rest of the staff room learned that Sheba was married with two children; that her husband was alecturer; that her children were educated privately; that she lived in "a ginormous house" in Highgate.Inevitably, given the quality of th...</p><h2>Inboard Motor Installations</h2><p>Authoritative and very detailed procedures for choosing and installing engines.

Journalist Cornelius Ryan began working on the book in the mid-1950s, while the memories of the D-day participants were still fresh, and he spent three years interviewing D-day survivors in the United States and Europe. When his book was first published in 1959, it was tremendously successful, establishing many of the legends of D-day that endure in the public's mind. Ryan was enormously skillful at weaving small personal stories into the overall narrative, and he would later use the same technique to depict the airborne invasion of Holland in <i>A Bridge Too Far</i>. Not only is <i>The Longest Day</i> a pleasure to read, but subsequent historians, dutifully noting its accuracy, have relied heavily on Ryan's research for their own accounts. In short, the book is a "must read" for anyone interested in the D-day invasion. <i>--Robert McNamara</i>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Beyond Prediction: The Tarot and Your Spirituality</h2><p>Tarot cards have long&nbsp;been a fascination for those interested in spiritual experimentation, and a horror for many church-goers.

That these poems have never lacked a popular audience has been a persistent annoyance in academic and literary circles; that they attracted the admiration of innovative poetic masters in Europe and especially France&#x2015;notably Baudelaire, Mallarm�, and Val�ry&#x2015;has been further cause for embarrassment. Jerome McGann offers a bold reassessment of Poe&#x2019;s achievement, arguing that he belongs with Whitman and Dickinson as a foundational American poet and cultural presence.</p><p>Not all American commentators have agreed with Emerson&#x2019;s dim view of Poe&#x2019;s verse. For McGann, a notable exception is William Carlos Williams, who said that the American poetic imagination made its first appearance in Poe&#x2019;s work. <i>The Poet Edgar Allan Poe</i> explains what Williams and European admirers saw in Poe, how they understood his poetics, and why his poetry had such a decisive influence on Modern and Post-Modern art and writing. McGann contends that Poe was the first poet to demonstrate how the creative imagination could escape its inheritance of Romantic attitudes and conventions, and why an escape was desirable. The ethical and political significance of Poe&#x2019;s work follows from what the poet takes as his great subject: the reader.</p><p><i>The Poet Edgar Allan Poe</i> takes its own readers on a spirited tour through a wide range of Poe&#x2019;s verse as well as the critical and theoretical writings in which he laid out his arresting ideas about poetry and poetics.</p></p><p>Jerome McGann is University Professor and John Stewart Bryan Professor of English at the University of Virginia.<b>McGann</b> [wants] to set the record straight, right an imbalance and show why Poe deserves a place beside Whitman and Emily Dickinson, the venerated father and mother of American poetry. His marvelous short book combines old-fashioned &#x2018;close reading&#x2019; with a capacious historical and theoretical sense of Poe&#x2019;s place in American literature and mid-19th-century American culture...McGann&#x2019;s basic thesis about Poe&#x2019;s poems (he calls them &#x2018;Poe-try&#x2019;) and his remarks about individual gestures, lines, sounds and rhythms are constantly engaging. Readers who believe that God is in the details will find plenty to astonish them...By moving away from poetry&#x2019;s expository and thematic features to its aesthetic and rhetorical ones, McGann has performed an important cultural and intellectual service. (Willard Spiegelman <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br><i>The Poet Edgar Allan Poe: Alien Angel</i> promises to save Poe&#x2019;s poetry from [a] dire critical fate...[<b>McGann</b>&#x2019;s] aim is ambitious: to give Poe&#x2019;s poetry academic significance, to establish both its aesthetic appeal and its political relevance. As Edmund Wilson does in his appreciative essay &#x2018;Poe at Home and Abroad,&#x2019; McGann figures Poe&#x2019;s work as the suspension bridge across the chasm separating romanticism and modernism. He situates Poe&#x2019;s work alongside and against the romantic poetry of Keats, Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth; evaluates Poe&#x2019;s sonic influence on the writing of Rimbaud, Mallarm�, Baudelaire; and, expands upon Eliot&#x2019;s essay &#x2018;From Poe to Val�ry&#x2019; to trace the influence of Poe&#x2019;s critique of the romantic &#x2018;I&#x2019; through symbolism into high modern elasticism, and then, into language poetry and the latest work of Charles Bernstein. He demonstrates Poe&#x2019;s unquestionable impact on the way Americans thought about poetry and the way poetry thought about itself. (Ava Kofman <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Elegant...One of <b>McGann</b>&#x2019;s greatest services is to introduce lay readers to Poe&#x2019;s critical writings. He excerpts several longish selections from Poe&#x2019;s correspondence and reviews as well as the <i>Marginalia</i>, sundry magazine pieces he authored between 1845 and 1849. What emerges is an Edgar Allan Poe who thought profoundly about poetry and literature and who was able, mostly, to express his ideas and theories in clear prose. (John S. Sledge <i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i>)<br><br><b>McGann</b> has set out to address and correct the problem of Poe&#x2019;s poetry, and the result is a necessary volume not only for those compelled and beguiled by Poe but for anyone who understands the importance of poetic tradition and its umbilical to American imagination. This book is McGann&#x2019;s deep-seeing riposte to those critics&#x2015;Emerson, Yvor Winters, D.H. Lawrence, Harold Bloom, et al.&#x2015;who have dismissed Poe&#x2019;s aesthetics as by turns decadent and preposterous... Part of the large pleasure of McGann&#x2019;s book is his contra-academic gift of phrase, his parsed insights into Poe&#x2019;s &#x2018;legend-laden life&#x2019; and the &#x2018;angel of the odd&#x2019; suspended over his writing desk.

(<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br><b>McGann</b> persuasively defends Poe&#x2019;s poetry against its many detractors, who have criticized the work as all &#x2018;jingle&#x2019; (Ralph Waldo Emerson) and lacking in &#x2018;intellectual content&#x2019; (Yvor Winters). Through close readings of Poe&#x2019;s marginalia, reviews, and letters, as well as his essays on poetic composition, notably &#x2018;The Poetic Principle,&#x2019; McGann shows how Poe worked out a sophisticated theory of poetics...It will certainly provide readers with a deeper appreciation of the writer&#x2019;s achievements as a poet. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br><b>McGann</b> restores Poe to his foundational role for American, and 19th century, poetics.

In this sense, Poe is once again Our Contemporary...In making the case for the close link between the poetry and the aesthetic theory, [McGann] succeeds admirably: Poe&#x2019;s reputation as <i>poete maudit</i> belies the fact that here was a poet who knew exactly what he was doing.

The first three-quarters of the book give an evenhanded account of the rise of the Chinese Communist Party. Unfortunately, the last quarter of the book degenerates into a choppy compilation of anecdotes derived from published sources. Mao is depicted as a fanatic ideologue, and the Cultural Revolution is described superficially, with no understanding that might shed light on the recent prodemocracy movement. The photographs, many of which have been published before, give a relentlessly grim picture of 20th-century China, showing nothing of the Chinese people's achievements, only their suffering and victimization. Marrin has a flare for drama, but his repetition of bloody and violent detail risks perpetuating the stereotype of Orientals as more callous and cruel than the rest of humanity. Although he provides a good bibliography, the text is full of unidentified quotes and undocumented incidents. Jean Fritz' personal interviews with survivors give a stronger ring of authenticity to her account of China's Long March (Putnam, 1988). Jerome's Mao (Prentice-Hall, 1969; o.p.), a compilation of Mao's early writings, allows readers to make their own judgments. Don Lawson's The Long March (Crowell, 1983) and Jules Archer's Mao Tse-tung (Hawthorne, 1972; o.p.) are outdated. Until a biographer with more insight tackles the subject, Marrin's book could be useful for its vivid history of 20th-century China. --Margaret A.

He knew that voice. It tugged at parts of him that had lain dormant for a long time&#x2014;or never genuinely existed at all, depending on one&#x2019;s viewpoint.<br><br>He shied away from both memory and contemplation. There was no point wasting energy on either when his very survival was at stake. How many days he had been down the pit he no longer knew, but in that time he had neither eaten nor slept. His enemy wasn&#x2019;t physical in the sense of a foe he could strike down or manipulate. It was himself&#x2014;his fallible body, his weak mind, his faltering spirit. He would endure and emerge whole, or never emerge at all.<br><br>Such was the life of Darth Vader&#x2019;s secret apprentice.<br><br>&#x201c;He is dead.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then he is now more powerful than ever.&#x201d;<br><br>More voices. He closed his eyes and shook his head. Kneeling, he placed his manacled hands on the slick metal surface below him and concentrated on hearing the world outside.<br><br>Long stretches of isolation had attuned him to the cloning �facility&#x2019;s many moods. Through the metal he heard a relentless hiss that could only be rain. Sharp cracking sounds were lightning, com�ing and going in staccato waves. Rolling rumbles were thunder, and a deeper note still was the song of �seabed-�hugging currents that circled the world.<br><br>He was on Kamino. Starkiller was sure of that much. He had been reborn on the distant waterworld, where a significant percentage of the Emperor&#x2019;s stormtroopers were grown. Here it was that he would live and grow strong, or die weak and unmourned. Every hardship, every hurdle, was one step closer to full mastery of his fate. That was the lesson underlying all lessons.<br><br>A new note entered the planet&#x2019;s endless song: the scream of a TIE advanced prototype starfighter. Angular and fleet, with bent vanes, it entered the atmosphere with a �whip-�crack sonic boom and descended on a bold, �high-�energy descent toward the facility.<br><br>Starkiller tensed. He knew that ship&#x2019;s sound and could sense the �well-�practiced hand behind its controls. He heard stormtroopers marching quickly in response to their master&#x2019;s electronic summons, calling orders to one another as they went. Blast doors opened and closed with booming thuds. The facility woke from its unattended slumber.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t move as the TIE fighter landed. He didn&#x2019;t open his eyes as two heavy, booted feet dropped onto the platform and began the long walk through the facility. He breathed at a steady pace through the whine of the turbolift and the hiss of doors opening. A ring of red lights at the top of the pit came on, and although he felt the light against his hunched back, he didn&#x2019;t look up.<br><br>He heard breathing, mechanical and regular. Heavy footsteps came to the very lip of the pit, and stopped.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re alive,&#x201d; said Darth Vader.<br><br>At the voice of his former Master, Starkiller looked up, blinking against the light. Vader&#x2019;s boots were three meters above him, barely visible behind the lights and the grate that separated the pit from the dark room beyond. The Dark Lord loomed like a shadow, a black hole in the shape of a robed man.<br><br>Starkiller&#x2019;s throat worked. It was so dry he could barely talk at all.<br><br>&#x201c;How long this time?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thirteen days. Impressive.&#x201d;<br><br>The compliment was �hard-�won. It ground out of the triangular grille covering Vader&#x2019;s mouth and fell on Starkiller&#x2019;s ears like dust.<br><br>&#x201c;The Force gives me all I need.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Force?&#x201d;<br><br>The hint of praise turned to warning, as it did so often.<br><br>Starkiller lowered his head. He knew what was required. The weeks of training and isolation he had endured made that exceedingly clear.<br><br>&#x201c;The dark side, I mean, my Master.&#x201d;<br><br>One gloved hand moved. The grate flew open.<br><br>&#x201c;Come,&#x201d; said the dark figure above him.<br><br>The metal floor beneath Starkiller lurched and began to ascend. He forced his leg muscles to unlock from their long kneeling position, and stood to meet Darth Vader upright and unbowed.<br><br>The room above was sparsely furnished, with no windows, just one exit&#x2014;the turbolift&#x2014;and little light. Shadows cast by terminals and floor lamps made its very dimensions ambiguous, but Starkiller knew from long training exercises that the room was circular and its walls were impenetrable. He flexed his fingers, yearning for a lightsaber to hold. Muscle memory was keener than any other kind. Even with the new skills Darth Vader had taught him, his hands wanted to fight the way he knew best.<br><br>At the very edge of his vision stood several skeletal PROXY droids, awaiting activation. If he was lucky, he would be unshackled and allowed to duel some of them. If not . . .<br><br>The lift ground to a halt. Vader stepped back to study him. Starkiller felt the keen eye of the Sith Lord on his gaunt form even through the layers of durasteel, obsidian, and plasteel that covered the man&#x2019;s face. Something was different. Although nothing had been said, he could tell that this was no ordinary training session.<br><br>He waited. There was no hurrying Darth Vader.<br><br>&#x201c;I have a mission for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, my Master.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Starkiller&#x2019;s former conspirator has been captured.&#x201d;<br><br>He experienced a moment of confusion. Then his memories stirred, providing a name. The name of the one who had lured him away from the dark side and to his death.<br><br>The same voice that had disturbed him from his meditation . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Vader thinks he&#x2019;s turned you. But I can sense your future, and Vader isn&#x2019;t part of it. I sense only . . . me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;General Kota,&#x201d; he said, struggling to keep himself anchored to the present.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. You will travel to Cato Neimoidia and execute him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And then will my training be complete, Master?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You will not be ready to face the Emperor until you have faced a true Jedi Master.&#x201d;<br><br>The voice was Darth Vader&#x2019;s, but again from another time, �another memory. The �present-�day Darth Vader hadn&#x2019;t spoken at all.<br><br>Starkiller put his manacled hands to his head and turned away, lest his disconcertion be exposed. No matter how he tried, no matter how he concentrated, the past simply wouldn&#x2019;t leave him alone.<br><br>Vader&#x2019;s close attention hadn&#x2019;t ebbed. &#x201c;You are still haunted by visions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; There was no point denying it. &#x201c;Yes, my Master.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me what you see.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t know where to start. Thirteen days, this time, he had stayed motionless in the pit, subjected to visions and hallucinations through all his senses: strange odors, fleeting touches, voices calling him, sights he could never have imagined. He tried to ignore them, and when he couldn&#x2019;t ignore them, he tried to piece them together instead. Neither was entirely possible, and every attempt hurt so badly he despaired of it ever ending.<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes,&#x201d; he said, falteringly, &#x201c;I smell a forest on fire.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Continue.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see the general falling, and feel the ground shake as a starship crashes around me. And I hear a woman&#x2014;a woman&#x2019;s voice&#x2014;when I try to sleep.&#x201d; He swallowed. This was the most painful recollection of all. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t understand what she&#x2019;s saying. Do you know who she is?&#x201d;<br><br>A pleading note had entered his voice, and he hated himself for it.<br><br>&#x201c;They are the memories of a dead man.&#x201d; Vader came closer, his physical presence lending weight to his words. &#x201c;A side effect of the accelerated cloning process and the memory flashes used to train you. They will fade.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What if they don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you will be of no use to me.&#x201d;<br><br>Starkiller straightened. For the first time, that fact had been said aloud. He had always known it was so; Darth Vader wasn&#x2019;t renowned for his charity. But to hear it stated so baldly&#x2014;that this Starkiller, this clone, would be disposed of like some faulty droid if he didn&#x2019;t pull himself together soon&#x2014;had a profoundly focusing effect.<br><br>Not for long.<br><br>&#x201c;Try the Corellian razor hounds.&#x201d;<br><br>That was a new voice, one he hadn&#x2019;t heard before. He winced, and knew that by wincing he had effectively doomed himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Starkiller&#x2019;s emotions made him weak,&#x201d; the Dark Lord said. &#x201c;If you are to serve me, you must be strong.&#x201d;<br><br>What form of service that might take, Darth Vader had never said. To take the former Starkiller&#x2019;s place, he presumed, as a weapon that could be aimed at the Emperor then Vader&#x2019;s enemies whenever he commanded. From treacherous commanders to perhaps the Emperor himself&#x2014;that was how it had been, and how he assumed it would be now. For the moment, however, that didn&#x2019;t matter. The new Starkiller wanted only to live.<br><br>&#x201c;I am strong, my Master, and I am getting stronger.&#x201d;<br><br>Vader stepped behind him and waved a hand. Metal complained as the manacles dropped from Starkiller&#x2019;s wrists and hit the floor with a boom.<br><br>&#x201c;Show me.&#x201d;<br><br>Numerous pairs of eyes lit up in the shadows. The PROXY droids were activating. Starkiller&#x2019;s fists balled in readiness. He had defeated their training programs over and over again. There �wasn&#x2019;t a Jedi simulation that could beat him.<br><br>But this was different. Even as Darth Vader provided him with his weapons&#x2014;two lightsabers with matched crystals, producing identical red blades&#x2014;he saw that he wouldn&#x2019;t be fighting Jedi Knights this time. The targets stepping out of the shadows wore uniforms not dissimilar in color to the Sith&#x2019;s ancient enemy, but these were ordinary men armed with nothing more than blasters.<br><br>He had seen such armor before, in the memories of the original Starkiller&#x2019;s life. Men like this had fought him in a TIE fighter factory high above Nar Shaddaa. They had been on Corellia, too. He remembered the places clearly, even if he couldn&#x2019;t put them in context. The uniforms weren&#x2019;t Imperial. That was the only thing he could be sure of.<br><br>More voices came to him, a veritable babble of overlapping statements that went some way to filling one hole in his memory.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll join your alliance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All we needed was someone to take the initiative.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let this be an official Declaration of Rebellion.&#x201d;<br><br>And he did remember now. The PROXY droids were wearing the uniform of Kota&#x2019;s militia, later adopted by the Rebellion&#x2014;the Rebellion the original Starkiller had brought into being through a mixture of deceit and something that felt, through the obscuring veils of the cloning process, remarkably like sincerity.<br><br>&#x201c;You must destroy what he created,&#x201d; Darth Vader intoned.<br><br>Starkiller ground his teeth together. If he was going to survive the coming minutes, he had to concentrate. He wasn&#x2019;t really destroying the Rebellion, just an imitation of it. And what did the Rebellion matter now, anyway? It existed. The original Starkiller was dead. He needed to move on.<br><br>The troopers rushed him from all sides. Twin red blades flashed as he met their advance, spinning and slashing with an easy grace that belied the strength behind it. Mastery of the Jar&#x2019;Kai �dual-�lightsaber fighting style hadn&#x2019;t come easily, even given his inherited knowledge of the Niman and Ataru techniques. Using two blades came with both advantages and disadvantages. Although he could attack or defend himself against more than one opponent at once, he could only wield his lightsabers �one-�handed, reducing the power of his blows.<br><br>Building up his physical strength had therefore been a key part of his training on Kamino, starting with simple weights and graduating to combat training with droids like these. Dueling the Dark Lord himself had come last of all, and he had clung to that ultimate challenge even as his mind played games with him. He might not know who he was, but he could learn&#x2014;and had learned&#x2014;how to fight.<br><br>Fight he did, deflecting every attack the �faux-�Rebels dealt against him, singly or in pairs and trios. Holographic limbs and blasters were no match for his blades. Sparks flew. Droids fell in pieces. Brown uniforms turned red with illusory blood.<br><br>More droids issued from the wall, crowding him, coming at him in waves of four or more. Starkiller went into a fighting trance, stabbing and sweeping complex arcs through the air. His nostrils were full of smoke. The stink cleared his head. No more voices assailed him, and no doubts, either. He was who he was. Born to kill, he killed.<br><br>With a roar he forced his way through a wall of Rebels, slashing and hacking as he went. They fell apart on either side, leaving just one standing before him. He raised both blades to strike him down.<br><br>Not him. Her. She was a slender, blond woman in an officer&#x2019;s uniform clutching a blaster in both hands.<br><br>Starkiller froze.<br><br>He knew that face.<br><br>He took a step toward the woman.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re still loyal to Vader! After all he did to us&#x2014;branding me a traitor and trying to kill you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>The words in his head wouldn&#x2019;t be drowned out.<br><br>&#x201c;I saw you die. But you&#x2019;ve come back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he repeated, raising his blades.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make me leave another life behind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d;<br><br>The woman cowered before him. &#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; she said in a voice identical to the one in his head. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now the fate of this Alliance rests only with you.&#x201d;<br><br>He lowered his blades, stunned out of his fighting trance. The voices were the same!<br><br>Memories stirred in his mind. Images of the woman before him came in a bewildering rush. Vader wanted him to destroy everyone the original Starkiller had fought with, and that meant this woman, this Rebel officer, this . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Juno?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Strike her down&#x201d; came the command from Vader.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You must learn to hate what he loved,&#x201d; said Vader, and suddenly it was just the three of them in the center of the �droid-�strewn training ground. Starkiller, the Sith who had created him, and a woman from the first Starkiller&#x2019;s past.<br><br>Conflicting impulses warred within him, triggered by the ongoing cascade of recollections. Juno was Juno Eclipse, the woman Starkiller had, yes, loved. But he wasn&#x2019;t Starkiller, so what did he owe her? He was just a clone, and she was only a droid, an illusion fashioned to test him. What did it matter if he did as he was told, as he had been bred to do?<br><br>His hands trembled. The twin red blades wavered. They grew steadier as he drew his elbows back, preparing to strike.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;ll never need to live this down.&#x201d;<br><br>He remembered a tender pressure against his lips, the feel of her body against his, a heat he had never experienced before, in this life or any other . . .<br><br>He couldn&#x2019;t do it. He couldn&#x2019;t kill her.<br><br>With a double click, he deactivated his blades. His arms came down and hung at his sides.<br><br>&#x201c;It is as I feared.&#x201d;<br><br>Darth Vader lashed out, channeling the dark side with practiced ease. Starkiller winced, but it was the training droid the Dark Lord had targeted. His lightsaber sliced it neatly in two. The image of Juno Eclipse vanished in a shower of sparks.<br><br>Starkiller held his ground. No more my Master. No more pretense. &#x201c;What will you do with me?&#x201d;<br><br>Darth Vader strode to face his former apprentice, kicking the body of the droid out of his path.<br><br>&#x201c;You will receive the same treatment as the others.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What others?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Those who came before you went mad within months, tormented by emotional imprints I was unable to erase. Some would not kill their father, others their younger self. With you, it is this woman. Now you will suffer the fate they did.&#x201d;<br><br>Starkiller bowed his head, rocked by the revelation that he wasn&#x2019;t the only Starkiller Darth Vader had re-created.

Visit her at www.candace-camp.com.<i>London, 1816</i><p>Irene covered a sigh as her sister-in-law continued her description&#x2014;in detail&#x2014;of the gown she had purchased yesterday. It was not that Irene disliked talk of fashion; indeed, she was fonder than she cared to admit of conversations regarding styles and colors and accessories. It was listening to Maura converse about clothes that bored Irene to the point of unconsciousness, for anything Maura discussed was ultimately more about Maura and her own taste or perspicacity or beauty than it was about the subject at hand.</p><p>Maura was, quite simply, the sun around which all interests and all people circled, at least in her own mind. She was unremittingly self-centered, which Irene would not have minded so much if she had not been thoroughly dull and prosaic, as well.</p><p>Irene glanced around the room at the faces of the other women. None of their three visitors, she saw, looked as indifferent or bored as she felt. She wondered if her own expression conveyed as little of her inner reaction. It was difficult to tell, no doubt because all the well-bred ladies had been brought up, as she had, to convey a polite interest in other people's conversations, no matter how tedious they were.</p><p>Irene's mother, Lady Claire, was one of the women now listening to Maura with a pleasant and interested look on her face. She would, of course, have considered it bad form to have allowed any other expression to mar her features, but Irene knew that more was involved; her mother was frightened to express a dislike for, or even a disinterest in, anything her daughter-in-law had to say. For the past year, ever since Humphrey had married Maura and brought her back here to live with them, Lady Claire had walked on eggshells, knowing that Maura was now the true power in the household, and could make her and her daughter's life a misery.</p><p>Of course, in Irene's opinion, having to bow to Maura's every whim already made life a misery, so it seemed foolish to work so hard to avoid the woman's ire. Nor did she think that her brother Humphrey was so weak-willed as to turn his mother and sister out of their home if Maura took it into her head to demand that. However, she knew that it was certainly within his power to do so, as well as in Maura's nature to selfishly demand such a thing. And it was, unfortunately, quite true that she and her mother had been left virtually penniless upon Lord Wyngate's death and were completely dependent upon her brother's generosity.</p><p>Lord Wyngate had died three years ago in a fall from his horse after a particularly heavy bout of drinking. Irene had been, frankly, somewhat surprised at the grief she had felt. After all the years of battling with the man and despising him, there had, it seemed, been a core of love inside her that even his wicked behavior had been unable to entirely squelch. However, there was no denying that his demise had also evoked a great sense of relief in all those connected to him.</p><p>There were no more bill collectors lurking outside their door; that had stopped once Humphrey had sat down with their creditors and worked out a plan to pay his father's debts in full. Nor were shady characters popping up looking for Lord Wyngate anymore. They had no further need to fear that he would bring some scandal to the family name. And, most of all, his presence no longer hung over the house like some dark cloud, forcing everyone do whatever they could to avoid running into him or doing anything that might set off one of his fits of rage.</p><p>It was not until after Lord Wyngate was dead that, upon hearing one of the upstairs maids singing a cheerful song as she polished the furniture, Irene realized just how silent and cold the house had been. Suddenly, despite the black wreath on the front door and the black cloth draped above Lord Wyngate's portrait, the house was a lighter, brighter place.</p><p>Her younger brother, Humphrey, a rather serious, shy young man, had, of course, inherited the title and estate from their father. Aside from the entailed land and the house in London, Lord Wyngate had left little but debts for his heir; for his widow and daughter there had been nothing.</p><p>However, Humphrey was a loving son and brother, and he was happy to provide for Irene and Claire. Two years younger than Irene, he had always looked up to and relied upon her. In their childhood, it had been she who had shielded him from their father's curses and blows.</p><p>Humphrey had set about settling his father's debts and rebuilding the estate, leaving it to his sister to run the household, as she long had done for her mother. Life had moved along smoothly enough as they emerged from the period of mourning into a resumption of social activities. The debts had been largely repaid, and though there was a heavy mortgage on the entailed land that had passed to Humphrey, the money situation had loosened enough to allow for new dresses and the giving and attending of parties.</p><p>Irene knew that some found her life pitiable, as she was in her midtwenties and still unmarried, facing life as a spinster, but she did not care. The fact was that she was happy and useful, and she was not one of those women&#x2014; those she privately characterized as foolish females&#x2014;who found her life empty if it was not connected to a man's. Indeed, having witnessed the storms of marriage, she was certain that her life without a husband was far preferable to the one most married women endured.</p><p>Then Humphrey had taken a hunting trip to the North of England with a friend. His visit had been extended by first one week, then two, and at the end of the third week, he had returned home, flushed and happy with the news that he was engaged to be married.</p><p>Maura Ponsonby, the daughter of a local squire, had caught Humphrey's eye...and then his lonely heart. She was a jewel, he informed them, and he was the luckiest man alive. They would, he assured them, love Maura just as he did.</p><p>When they met Maura, it was easy enough to see why he had fallen in love with her. She was pretty, and she showered Humphrey with attention and affection. However, it did not take them long to see how she also controlled him with her pretty pouting and lively flirtation turning stony and un-yielding when she did not get her way.</p><p>All smiles and charmingly deferential to Lady Claire before she married Humphrey, she swept into the house after the wedding full of self-importance. As the new Lady Wyngate, she made it quite clear to both Claire and Irene that she was now in charge. Though Irene had intended to turn over the running of Wyngate Hall to Maura, the woman gave her no opportunity to do so, merely informed the housekeeper and butler that she would now be in charge of all decisions regarding the household.</p><p>Maura seized every opportunity to show that she was of primary rank in the house, inserting herself into any conversation, informing the butler whom they would or would not receive as callers and when they were at home to such visits, and boldly accepting or declining invitations for Irene and Claire, as well as for herself and her husband.</p><p>Lady Claire, as was her way, had submitted meekly to such behavior. Irene, of course, had refused to knuckle under, and the result had been a long series of skirmishes between the two women.</p><p>Now Maura, perhaps sensing Irene's disinterest, broke off in the middle of her description of the bows that adorned the hem of her dress and turned toward Irene, eyes wide, smiling in an arch way that made Irene itch to slap her. "But we are boring poor Irene with our talk of frills and furbelows, aren't we, dear?" She turned gaily toward the other women, saying, "Irene has little interest in fashion, I fear. Try as I might, I can hardly ever convince her to let me buy her a thing to wear."</p><p>Maura shook her head, a picture of loving despair over Irene's odd ways, setting her soft dark curls bobbing.</p><p>"You are so generous, my dear Lady Wyngate," murmured Mrs. Littlebridge.</p><p>"I am well content with my clothes," Irene responded coolly.</p><p>Lady Claire, as always, quickly stepped into the conversation to avoid the possibility of conflict. "Miss Cantwell, you must tell us about the wedding at Redfields. I am sure we are all eager to hear about it."</p><p>Irene's mother had chosen the topic well. The marriage of the Viscount Leighton to Constance Woodley a week before had been the highlight of the social year, and an invitation to witness the wedding at Leighton's family estate had been highly sought after. All those who had managed to attend were assured of being welcomed almost everywhere for their description of the wedding.</p><p>"Yes, indeed," Mrs. Littlebridge agreed. An inveterate social climber, she loved nothing more than gossip and storing up tales that she could repeat to make herself appear more important than she was. "Was the bride radiant?"</p><p>"She is pretty in her own way," Miss Cantwell admitted. "But no family to speak of. One cannot help but feel that the viscount has married down."</p><p>"Of course." Mrs. Littlebridge nodded sagely. "A bit of a country mouse, I hear."</p><p>"Exactly." Miss Cantwell gave the other woman a thin smile. "But then, Leighton always has been a bit...well, unconventional."</p><p>Irene, who felt sure that Miss Cantwell's opinion of the viscount's oddity sprang more from that very eligible bach-elor's complete disinterest in her own person than from anything else, said, "I quite like Miss Woodley&#x2014;or I should say now, Lady Leighton. I find her refreshingly unpretentious."</p><p>Maura let out a little brittle laugh. "You would find that admirable, of course, Irene. Not everyone admires a lack of refinement as you do, I fear."</p><p>"I believe Lady Leighton was a good friend of the viscount's sister, was she not?" Lady Claire said quickly.</p><p>"Oh, yes, Lady Haughston took her on as one of her projects," Mrs. Littlebridge affirmed. "She introduced the girl to her brother, of course."</p><p>"And before that, she completely made the girl over." Mrs. Cantwell spoke up. "Constance Woodley was an utter dowd before Lady Haughston came along and turned her into a swan."</p><p>"She has a knack for it," Lady Claire commented. "There was that Bainborough gir...</p></p><h2>A Crowning Mercy</h2><p><p>&#x201c;If you love historical drama...then look no further.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>Boston Globe</i><br><br>&nbsp;Bernard Cornwell, the perennial <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Richard Sharpe series and &#x201c;perhaps the greatest writer of historical adventure novels today&#x201d; (<i>Washington Post</i>) joins co-author Susannah Kells for <i>A Crowning Mercy</i>&#x2014;a breathtaking romantic adventure set against the dramatic backdrop of the English Civil War.

Others have done the same, of course, but Graham has followed the princess from the beginning of her royal life. It is even possible that readers will see some unfamiliar photos among the 225 color shots. Blanchard provides the informative text, noting where, when, and how many times outfits were worn, which were sold at auction (and for how much), etc. Even the most jaded reader will be moved when comparing early pictures of "Shy Di," dressed in fairy-tale ruffles and lace to the last photos of a confident and radiant woman in jeans at work on the Campaign To Ban Land Mines. Expect high demand: magazines will be excerpting this book, which is being published to coincide with a traveling exhibit of Diana's dresses. Strongly recommended for all public libraries and fashion-related collections.?Elizabeth Mary Mellett, Brookline P.L., MA<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Since Diana's death, her life has been examined from numerous angles; this time, we see her through the lens of fashion. Diana's fashion sense was analyzed from the moment she stepped on the public stage, and as the most photographed woman in the world, she gave fashion critics plenty to ponder. Photographer Graham, who took thousands of pictures of Diana (including those used in the Christie sale catalog), and fashion-reporter Blanchard look closely at the clothes Diana wore. Rather than moving completely chronologically, the book is divided into chapters that break down her clothes into categories: working wardrobe; diplomatic dressing; casual chic. The color photographs are more than just nice pictures--they give a close-up and personal look at Diana and her evolving fashion sense. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>The Only Land They Knew: The Tragic Story of the American Indians in the Old South</h2><p>From the dust jacket: &#34;The Only Land They Knew is the first full account of the Indians who lived in what became the Southern United States. From the arrival of Ponce de Leon in Florida in 1513 to the tragic &#39;Trail of Tears&#39; in the 1830s, this book captures the history, customs, and contributions of the great tribes of the region: the Creeks, Cherokees, Chickasaws, Seminoles, Yamasees, Powhatans, and Catawbas. Wright describes these &#39;original Southerners&#39; in fascinating detail: their homes, laws, religions, economies, and their way of life. And he chronicles the waves of Spanish, French, British, Africans, and Americans, whose arrival shattered this world of peaceful villages that once dotted the land from the Carolina low country to the Mississippi River. Rich in detail -- with illustrations, maps, and photographs -- The Only Land They Knew is a must-read book for anyone interested in American history, in the American Indian, and in the peoples of the Old South.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Best American Poetry 2014 (The Best American Poetry series)</h2><p>Edited by the National Book Award-winning poet Terrance Hayes, the foremost annual anthology of contemporary American poetry returns: &#x201c;A &#x2018;best&#x2019; anthology that really lives up to its title&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>).<br><br>The first book of poetry that Terrance Hayes ever bought was the 1990 edition of <i>The Best American Poetry</i>, edited by Jorie Graham.

Don Draper sat sipping Canadian Club from a coffee mug on Craig Ferguson&#x2019;s late-night talk show. &#x201c;Are you on Twitter?&#x201d; the host asks. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Draper says. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t&#x201d;&#x2014;and here he pauses before pronouncing the distasteful verb&#x2014;&#x201c;tweet.&#x201d; Next question. &#x201c;Do you read a lot of poetry?&#x201d; The ad agency&#x2019;s creative director looks skeptical. Though the hero of Mad Men is seen reading Dante&#x2019;s Inferno in one season of Matthew Weiner&#x2019;s show and heard reciting Frank O&#x2019;Hara in another, the question seems to come from left field. &#x201c;Poetry isn&#x2019;t really celebrated any more in our culture,&#x201d; Don says, to which the other retorts, &#x201c;It can be&#x2014;if you can write in units of 140 keystrokes.&#x201d; Commercial break.<br> <br>The laugh line reveals a shrewd insight into the subject of &#x201c;poetry in the digital age,&#x201d; a panel-discussion perennial. The panelists agree that text messaging and Internet blogs will be seen to have exercised some sort of influence on the practice of poetry, whether on the method of composition or on the style and surface of the writing. And surely we may expect the same of a wildly popular social medium with a formal requirement as stringent as the 140-character limit. (To someone with a streak of mathematical mysticism, the relation of that number to the number of lines in a sonnet is a thing of beauty.) What Twitter offers is ultimate immediacy expressed with ultimate concision. &#x201c;Whatever else Twitter is, it&#x2019;s a literary form,&#x201d; says the novelist Kathryn Schulz, who explains how easy it was for her to get addicted to &#x201c;a genre in which you try to say an informative thing in an interesting way while abiding by its constraint (those famous 140 characters). For people who love that kind of challenge&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s easy to see why writers might be overrepresented among them&#x2014;Twitter has the same allure as gaming.&#x201d; True, the hard-to-shake habit caused its share of problems. Schulz reports a huge &#x201c;distractibility increase&#x201d; and other disturbing symptoms: &#x201c;I have felt my mind get divided into tweet-size chunks.&#x201d; Nevertheless there is a reason that she got hooked on this &#x201c;wide-ranging, intellectually stimulating, big-hearted, super fun&#x201d; activity.1 When, in an early episode of the Netflix production of House of Cards, one Washington journalist disparages a rival as a &#x201c;Twitter twat,&#x201d; you know the word has arrived, and the language itself has changed to accommodate it. There are new terms (&#x201c;hashtag&#x201d;), acronyms (&#x201c;ikr&#x201d; in Detroit means &#x201c;I know right?&#x201d;), shorthand (&#x201c;suttin&#x201d; is &#x201c;something&#x201d; in Boston).2 Television producers love it (&#x201c;Keep those tweets coming!&#x201d;). So does Wall Street: when Twitter went public in 2013, the IPO came off without a hitch, and the stock climbed with the velocity of an over-caffeinated momentum investor eager to turn a quick profit.<br> <br>The desire to make a friend of the new technology is understandable, though it obliges us to overlook some major flaws: the Internet is hell on lining, spacing, italics; line breaks and indentation are often obscured in electronic transmission. The integrity of the poetic line can be a serious casualty. Still, it is fruitless to quarrel with the actuality of change, and difficult to resist it profitably&#x2014;except, perhaps, in private, where we may revel in our physical books and even, if we like, write with pen or pencil on graph paper or type our thoughts with the Smith-Corona manual to which we have a sentimental attachment. One room in the fine &#x201c;Drawn to Language&#x201d; exhibit at the University of Southern California&#x2019;s Fisher Art Museum in September 2013 was devoted to Susan Silton&#x2019;s site-specific installation of a circle of tables on which sat ten manual typewriters of different makes, models, sizes, and decades. It was moving to behold the machines not only as objects of nostalgia in an attractive arrangement but as metonymies of the experience of writing in the twentieth century&#x2014;and as invitations to sit down and hunt and peck away to your heart&#x2019;s content. Seeing the typewriters in that room I felt as I do when the talk touches on the acquisition of an author&#x2019;s papers by a university library. It&#x2019;s odd to be a member of the last generation to have &#x201c;papers&#x201d; in this archival and material sense. Odd for an era to slip into a museum while you watch.<br> <br>You may say&#x2014;I have heard the argument&#x2014;that the one-minute poem is not far off. Twitter&#x2019;s 140-keystroke constraint&#x2014;together with the value placed on being &#x201c;up to speed&#x201d;&#x2014;brings the clock into the game. Poetry, a byte-size kind of poetry, has been, or soon will be, a benefit of attention deficit disorder. (This statement, or prediction, is not necessarily or not always made in disparagement.) Unlike the telephone, the instruments of social media rely on the written, not the spoken word, and it will be interesting to see what happens when the values of hip-hop lyricists and spoken-word poets, for whom the performative aspects of the art are paramount, tangle with the values of concision, bite, and wit consistent with the rules of the Twitter feed. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the sentence I have just composed will be, for all intents and purposes, anachronistic in a couple of years or less. Among my favorite oxymorons is &#x201c;ancient computer,&#x201d; applied to my own desktop.3<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>In his famous and famously controversial Rede Lecture at Cambridge University in 1959, the English novelist C. P. Snow addressed the widening chasm between the two dominant strains in our culture.4 There were the humanists on the one side. On the other were the scientists and applied scientists, the agents of technological change. And &#x201c;a gulf of mutual incomprehension&#x201d; separated them. Though Snow endeavored to appear evenhanded, it became apparent that he favored the sciences&#x2014;he opted, in his terms, for the fact rather than the myth. The scientists &#x201c;have the future in their bones&#x201d;&#x2014;a future that will nourish the hungry, clothe the masses, reduce the risk of infant mortality, cure ailments, and prolong life. And &#x201c;the traditional culture responds by wishing the future did not exist.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Rede Lecture came in the wake of the scare set off by the Soviet Union&#x2019;s launch of Sputnik in October 1957. There was widespread fear that we in the West, and particularly we in the United States, were in danger of falling behind the Russians in the race for space, itself a metaphor for the scientific control of the future. For this reason among others, Snow&#x2019;s lecture was extraordinarily successful. Introducing a phrase into common parlance, &#x201c;The Two Cultures&#x201d; reached great numbers of readers and helped shape a climate friendly to science at the expense of the traditional components of a liberal education. Much in that lecture infuriated the folks on the humanist side of the divide.5 Snow wrote as though humanistic values were possible without humanistic studies. In literature he saw not a corrective or a criticism of life but a threat. He interpreted George Orwell&#x2019;s 1984 as &#x201c;the strongest possible wish that the future should not exist&#x201d; rather than as a warning against the authoritarian impulses of the modern state coupled with its sophistication of surveillance. Snow founded his argument on the unexamined assumption that scientists, in thrall to the truth, can be counted on to do the right thing&#x2014;an assumption that the history of munitions would explode even if we could all agree on what &#x201c;the right thing&#x201d; is. For Snow, who had been knighted and would be granted a life peerage, the future was bound to be an improvement on the past, and the change would be entirely attributable to the people in the white coats in the laboratory. Generalizing from the reactionary political tendencies of certain famous modern writers, Snow floated the suggestion that they&#x2014;and by implication those who read them&#x2014;managed to &#x201c;bring Auschwitz that much nearer.&#x201d; Looking back at the Rede Lecture five years later, Snow saw no reason to modify the view that intellectuals were natural Luddites, prone to &#x201c;talk about a pre-Industrial Eden&#x201d; that never was. They ignored the simple truth that the historian J. H. Plumb stated: &#x201c;No one in his senses would choose to have been born in a previous age unless he could be certain that he would have been born into a prosperous family, that he would have enjoyed extremely good health, and that he could have accepted stoically the death of the majority of his children.&#x201d; In short, according to Snow, the humanists were content to dwell in a &#x201c;pretty-pretty past.&#x201d;<br> <br>In 1962 F. R. Leavis, then perhaps the most influential literary critic at Cambridge, denounced Snow&#x2019;s thesis with such vitriol and contempt that he may have done the humanist side more harm than good. &#x201c;Snow exposes complacently a complete ignorance,&#x201d; Leavis said in the Richmond Lecture, and &#x201c;is as intellectually undistinguished as it is possible to be.&#x201d; Yet, Leavis added, Snow writes in a &#x201c;tone of which one can say that, while only genius could justify it, one cannot readily think of genius adopting it.&#x201d;6 Reread today, the Richmond Lecture may be a classic of invective inviting close study. As rhetoric it was devastating. But as a document in a conflict of ideas, the Richmond Lecture left much to be desired. Leavis did not adequately address the charges that Snow leveled at literature and the arts on social and moral grounds.7 The scandal in personalities, the shrillness of tone, eclipsed the subject of the debate, which got fought out in the letters column of the literary press and was all the talk in the senior common rooms and faculty lounges of the English-speaking world.<br> <br>The controversy ignited by a pair of dueling lectures at Cambridge deserves another look now not only because fifty years have passed and we can better judge what has happened in the intervening period but because more than ever the humanities today stand in need of defense. In universities and liberal arts colleges, these are hard times for the study of ideas. In 2013, front page articles in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal screamed about the crisis in higher education especially in humanist fields: shrinking enrollments at liberal arts colleges; the shutting down of entire college departments; the elimination of courses and requirements once considered vital. The host of &#x201c;worrisome long-trends&#x201d; included &#x201c;a national decline in the number of graduating high-school seniors, a swarm of technologies driving down costs and profit margins, rising student debt, a soft job market for college graduates and stagnant household incomes.&#x201d;8 Is that all? No, and it isn&#x2019;t everything. There has also been a spate of op-ed columns suggesting that students would be wise to save their money, study something that can lead to gainful employment, and forget about majoring in modern dance, art history, philosophy, sociology, theology, or English unless they are independently wealthy.<br> <br>The cornerstones of the humanities, English and history, have taken a beating. At Yale, English was the most popular major in 1972&#x2013;73. It did not make the top five in 2012&#x2013;13. Twenty-one years ago, 216 Yale undergraduates majored in history; less than half that number picked the field last year.9 Harvard&#x2014;where English majors dwindled from 36 percent of the student body in 1954 to 20 percent in 2012&#x2014;has issued a report on the precipitous drop. Russell A. Berman of Stanford, in a piece in The Chronicle of Higher Education ominously entitled &#x201c;Humanist: Heal Thyself,&#x201d; observed that &#x201c;the marginalization of the great works of the erstwhile canon has impoverished the humanities,&#x201d; and that the Harvard report came to this important conclusion. But he noted, too, that it stopped short of calling for a great-books list of required readings. My heart sinks when I read such a piece and arrive at a paragraph in which the topic sentence is, &#x201c;Clearly majoring in the humanities has long been an anomaly for American undergraduates.&#x201d;10 Or is such a sentence&#x2014;constructed as if to sound value-neutral and judgment-free in the proper scientific manner&#x2014;part of the problem? The ability of an educated populace to read critically, to write clearly, to think coherently, and to retain knowledge&#x2014;even the ability to grasp the basic rules of grammar and diction&#x2014;seems to be declining at a pace consonant with the rise of the Internet search engine and the autocorrect function in computer programs.<br> <br>Not merely the cost but the value of a liberal arts education has come into doubt. The humanists find themselves in a bind. Consider the plight of the English department. &#x201c;The folly of studying, say, English Lit has become something of an Internet clich�&#x2014;the stuff of sneering &#x2018;Worst Majors&#x2019; listicles that seem always to be sponsored by personal-finance websites,&#x201d; Thomas Frank writes in Harper&#x2019;s.11 There is a new philistinism afoot, and the daunting price tag of college or graduate education adds an extra wrinkle to an argument of ferocious intensity. &#x201c;The study of literature has traditionally been felt to have a unique effectiveness in opening the mind and illuminating it, in purging the mind of prejudices and received ideas, in making the mind free and active,&#x201d; Lionel Trilling wrote at the time of the Leavis&#x2013;Snow controversy. &#x201c;The classic defense of literary study holds that, from the effect which the study of literature has upon the private sentiments of a student, there results, or can be made to result, an improvement in the intelligence, and especially the intelligence as it touches the moral life.&#x201d;12 It is vastly more difficult today to mount such a defense after three or more decades of sustained assault on canons of judgment, the idea of greatness, the related idea of genius, and the whole vast cavalcade of Western civilization.13 Heather Mac Donald writes more in sorrow than in anger that the once-proud English department at UCLA&#x2014;which even lately could boast of being home to more undergraduate majors than any other department in the nation&#x2014;has dismantled its core, doing away with the formerly obligatory four courses in Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton. You can now satisfy the requirements of an English major with &#x201c;alternative rubrics of gender, sexuality, race, and class.&#x201d; The coup, as Mac Donald terms it, took place in 2011 and is but one event in a pattern of academic changes that would replace a theory of education based on a &#x201c;constant, sophisticated dialogue between past and present&#x201d; with a consumer mind-set based on &#x201c;narcissism, an obsession with victimhood, and a relentless determination to reduce the stunning complexity of the past to the shallow categories of identity and class politics. Sitting atop an entire civilization of aesthetic wonders, the contemporary academic wants only to study oppression, preferably his or her own, defined reductively according to gonads and melanin.&#x201d;</p><h2>Riding the Iron Rooster: By Train through China</h2><p>The author recounts his experiences while traveling throughout Communist China by train, offering observations on the scenery and recalling conversations with Chinese citizens and other fellow travelers</p><p>invites you to join him on the journey of a lifetime, in the grand romanttic tradition, by train across Euope, through the vast underbelly of Asia and in the heart of Russia, and then up to China. Here is China by rail, as seen and heard through the eyes and ears of one of the most intrepid and insightful travel writers of our time.Theroux (The Old Patagonian Express, The Great Railway Bazaar) spent a year exploring China by train, and his impressions about what has and has not changed in the country, as gathered in hundreds of conversations with Chinese citizens, make up a large portion of the book. The Cultural Revolution and the vandalism of the Red Guards have left scars on both the land and the people. Mao's death brought a collective sigh of relief from the population; reforms brought about under Deng Xiaoping have generally been welcomed. Still, this is not a political book. Whether describing his dealings with a rock-hard bureaucracy, musing over the Chinese flirtation with capitalismthey've "turned the free market into a flea market"or commenting on the process of traveling, Theroux conducts the reader through this enormous country with wisdom, humor and a crusty warmth. Along the way are anecdotes about classic Chinese pornography (forbidden to the citizenry, but all right for "foreign friends"); 35-below-zero weather; the Chinese penchant for restructuring nature; and the omnipresent thermos of hot water for making tea. The last chapter, "The Train to Tibet," deals with the extremes to which the Chinese have gone in their attempts to subjugate the Tibetan people. Theroux develops an understanding of China through his travels, but he falls in love with Tibet. As in his previous works, he gives the reader much to relish and think about.

The <i>Times</i>&#x2019; only dedicated opinion columnist covering the food beat, Bittman routinely makes readers think twice about how the food we eat is produced, distributed, and cooked, and shines a bright light on the profound impact that diet&#x2014;both good and bad&#x2014;can have on our health and that of the planet. <br><br> In <i>A Bone to Pick</i>, Mark&#x2019;s most memorable and thought-provoking columns are compiled into a single volume for the first time. As abundant and safe as the American food supply appears to be, the state of our health reveals the presence of staggering deficiencies in both the system that produces food and the forces that regulate it. Bittman leaves no issue unexamined; agricultural practices, government legislation, fad diets, and corporate greed all come under scrutiny and show that the issues governing what ends up in our market basket and on our tables are both complex and often deliberately confusing. Unabashedly opinionated and invariably thought provoking, Bittman&#x2019;s columns have helped readers decipher arcane policy, unpack scientific studies, and deflate affronts to common sense when it comes to determining what &#x201c;eating well&#x201d; truly means. As urgent as the situation is, Mark contends that we can be optimistic about the future of our food and its impact on our health, as slow-food movements, better school-lunch programs, and even &#x201c;healthy fast food&#x201d; become part of the norm. <br><br> At once inspiring, enraging, and enlightening, <i>A Bone to Pick</i> is an essential resource for every reader eager to understand not only the complexities inherent in the American food system, but also the many opportunities that exist to improve it.</p><p>MARK BITTMAN is one of the country&#x2019;s best-known and most widely respected food writers. His <i>How to Cook Everything</i> books, with over a million copies in print, are a mainstay of the modern kitchen, and his manifesto on pursuing a part-time vegan diet, <i>VB6, </i>debuted at #1 on the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller list. Bittman's writings on food policy and cooking appear in the Dining, Op-Ed, and Magazine sections of the <i>New York Times</i>.1<br><br>Big Ag, Sustainability, and What&#x2019;s in Between<br><br>You can eat without farms, but for the last 10,000 years few humans have. For about 9,900 of those years, though, all farms were small and--at least arguably--more or less sustainable. That is, they put back into the earth, in the form of animal and even human waste and plant matter, just about as much as they took out. There were no synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and so on, and everything was pretty much what we&#x2019;d now call organic.<br><br>Much has changed. The dominant form of agriculture in the West is industrial, large-scale, fossil fuel and chemical dependent, and heavy on water use. It isn&#x2019;t sustainable--that is, it uses far more in resources than it returns to the land--and it poisons land, sea, animals, workers, and consumers. It&#x2019;s used primarily to grow a half dozen crops, among them corn and soybeans, much of which, sadly, are fed to animals, used as fuel (ethanol), or converted into the kind of junk that&#x2019;s largely responsible for obesity. And despite the fact that there&#x2019;s enough food produced to feed everyone on the planet adequately, tens of millions of Americans, and more than a billion people worldwide, struggle with hunger.<br><br>In short, it&#x2019;s a terrible &#x201c;system,&#x201d; and one that could be improved almost immeasurably if just a little bit of care were taken.<br>How to Feed the World<br><br>It&#x2019;s been 50 years since President John F. Kennedy spoke of ending world hunger, yet on the eve of World Food Day, Oct. 16, the situation remains dire. The question &#x201c;How will we feed the world?&#x201d; implies that we have no choice but to intensify industrial agriculture, with more high-tech seeds, chemicals, and collateral damage. Yet there are other, better options.<br><br>Something approaching a billion people are hungry, a number that&#x2019;s been fairly stable for more than 50 years, although it has declined as a percentage of the total population.<br><br>&#x201c;Feeding the world&#x201d; might as well be a marketing slogan for Big Ag, a euphemism for &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s ramp up sales,&#x201d; as if producing more cars would guarantee that everyone had one. But if it worked that way, surely the rate of hunger in the United States would not be the highest percentage of any developed nation, a rate closer to that of Indonesia than of Britain.<br><br>The world has long produced enough calories, around 2,700 per day per human, more than enough to meet the United Nations projection of a population of nine billion in 2050, up from the current seven billion. There are hungry people not because food is lacking, but because not all of those calories go to feed humans (a third go to feed animals, nearly 5 percent are used to produce biofuels, and as much as a third is wasted, all along the food chain).<br><br>The current system is neither environmentally nor economically sustainable, dependent as it is on fossil fuels and routinely resulting in environmental damage. It&#x2019;s geared to letting the half of the planet with money eat well while everyone else scrambles to eat as cheaply as possible.<br><br>While a billion people are hungry, about three billion people are not eating well, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, if you count obese and overweight people alongside those with micronutrient deficiencies. Paradoxically, as increasing numbers of people can afford to eat well, food for the poor will become scarcer, because demand for animal products will surge, and they require more resources like grain to produce. A global population growth of less than 30 percent is projected to double the demand for animal products. But there is not the land, water, or fertilizer--let alone the health care funding--for the world to consume Western levels of meat.<br><br>If we want to ensure that poor people eat and also do a better job than &#x201c;modern&#x201d; farming does at preserving the earth&#x2019;s health and productivity, we must stop assuming that the industrial model of food production and its accompanying disease-producing diet is both inevitable and desirable. I have dozens of friends and colleagues who say things like, &#x201c;I hate industrial ag, but how will we feed the poor?&#x201d;<br><br>Let&#x2019;s at last recognize that there are two food systems, one industrial and one of small landholders, or peasants if you prefer. The peasant system is not only here for good, it&#x2019;s arguably more efficient than the industrial model. According to the ETC Group, a research and advocacy organization based in Ottawa, the industrial food chain uses 70 percent of agricultural resources to provide 30 percent of the world&#x2019;s food, whereas what ETC calls &#x201c;the peasant food web&#x201d; produces the remaining 70 percent using only 30 percent of the resources.<br><br>Yes, it is true that high-yielding varieties of any major commercial monoculture crop will produce more per acre than peasant-bred varieties of the same crop. But by diversifying crops, mixing plants and animals, planting trees--which provide not only fruit but shelter for birds, shade, fertility through nutrient recycling, and more--small landholders can produce more food (and more kinds of food) with fewer resources and lower transportation costs (which means a lower carbon footprint), while providing greater food security, maintaining greater biodiversity, and even better withstanding the effects of climate change. (Not only that: their techniques have been demonstrated to be effective on larger-scale farms, even in the Corn Belt of the United States.) And all of this without the level of subsidies and other support that industrial agriculture has received in the last half-century, and despite the efforts of Big Ag to become even more dominant.<br><br>In fact if you define &#x201c;productivity&#x201d; not as pounds per acre but as the number of people fed per that same area, you find that the United States ranks behind both China and India (and indeed the world average), and roughly the same as Bangladesh, because so much of what we grow goes to animals and biofuels. (Regardless of how food is produced, delivered, and consumed, waste remains at about one third.) Thus, as the ETC&#x2019;s research director, Kathy Jo Wetter, says, &#x201c;It would be lunacy to hold that the current production paradigm based on multinational agribusiness is the only credible starting point for achieving food security.&#x201d; This is especially true given all of its downsides.<br><br>As Raj Patel, a fellow at the Institute for Food and Development Policy, puts it, &#x201c;The playing field has been tilted against peasants for centuries, and they&#x2019;ve still managed to feed more people than industrial agriculture. With the right kinds of agroecological training and the freedom to shape the food system on fair terms, it&#x2019;s a safe bet that they&#x2019;ll be able to feed themselves, and others as well.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet obviously not all poor people feed themselves well, because they lack the essentials: land, water, energy, and nutrients. Often that&#x2019;s a result of cruel dictatorship (North Korea) or war, displacement and strife (the Horn of Africa, Haiti, and many other places), or drought or other calamities. But it can also be an intentional and direct result of land and food speculation and land and water grabs, which make it impossible for peasants to remain in their home villages. (Governments of many developing countries may also act as agents for industrial agriculture, seeing peasant farming as &#x201c;inefficient.&#x201d;)<br><br>The result is forced flight to cities, where peasants become poorly paid laborers, enter the cash market for (increasingly mass produced) food, and eat worse. (They&#x2019;re no longer &#x201c;peasants,&#x201d; at this point, but more akin to the working poor of the United States, who also often cannot afford to eat well, though not to the point of starvation.) It&#x2019;s a formula for making not only hunger but obesity: remove the ability to produce food, then remove the ability to pay for food, or replace it with only one choice: bad food.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not news that the poor need money and justice. If there&#x2019;s a bright side here, it&#x2019;s that the changes required to &#x201c;fix&#x201d; the problems created by &#x201c;industrial agriculture&#x201d; are perhaps more tractable than those created by inequality.<br><br>We might begin by ditching the narrow focus on yields (as Jonathan Foley, director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota, says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not &#x2018;grow baby grow&#x2019; &#x201d;), which seem to be ebbing naturally as land quality deteriorates and chemicals become less effective (despite high-tech &#x201c;advances&#x201d; like genetically engineered crops). Better, it would seem, would be to ask not how much food is produced, but how it&#x2019;s produced, for whom, at what price, cost, and benefit.<br><br>We also need to see more investment in researching the benefits of traditional farming. Even though simple techniques like those mentioned above give measurably excellent results, because they&#x2019;re traditional--even ancient--&#x201c;technologies,&#x201d; and because their benefits in profiting multinationals or international trade are limited, they&#x2019;ve never received investment on the same scale as corporate agriculture. (It&#x2019;s impossible not to point out here that a similar situation exists between highly subsidized and damaging fossil fuels and oft-ignored yet environmentally friendly renewables.)<br><br>Instead, the money and energy (of all kinds) focused on boosting supply cannot be overstated. If equal resources were put into reducing waste--which aside from its obvious merits would vastly prevent the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions--questioning the value of animal products, reducing overconsumption (where &#x201c;waste&#x201d; becomes &#x201c;waist&#x201d;), actively promoting saner, less energy-consuming alternatives, and granting that peasants have the right to farm their traditional landholdings, we could not only ensure that people could feed themselves but also reduce agriculture&#x2019;s contribution to greenhouse gases, chronic disease, and energy depletion.<br><br>This isn&#x2019;t about &#x201c;organic&#x201d; versus &#x201c;modern.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s about supporting the system in which small producers make decisions based on their knowledge and experience of their farms in the landscape, as opposed to buying standardized technological fixes in a bag. Some people call this knowledge-based rather than energy-based agriculture, but obviously it takes plenty of energy; as it happens, much of that energy is human, which can be a good thing. Frances Moore Lapp�, author of Diet for a Small Planet, calls it &#x201c;relational,&#x201d; and says, &#x201c;Agroecology is not just healthy sustainable food production but the seed of a different way of relating to one another, and to the earth.&#x201d;<br><br>That may sound new age-y, but so be it; all kinds of questions and all kinds of theories are needed if we&#x2019;re going to produce food sustainably. Supporting, or at least not obstructing, peasant farming is one key factor, but the other is reining in Western-style monoculture and the standard American diet it creates.<br><br>Some experts are at least marginally optimistic about the second half of this: &#x201c;The trick is to find the sweet spot,&#x201d; says Mr. Foley of the University of Minnesota, &#x201c;between better nutrition and eating too much meat and junk. The optimistic view is to hope that the conversation about what&#x2019;s wrong with our diet may deflect some of this. Eating more meat is voluntary, and how the Chinese middle class winds up eating will determine a great deal.&#x201d; Of course, at the moment, that middle class shows every indication that it&#x2019;s moving in the wrong direction; China is the world&#x2019;s leading consumer of meat, a trend that isn&#x2019;t slowing.<br><br>But if the standard American diet represents the low point of eating, a question is whether the developing world, as it hurtles toward that nutritional nadir--the polar opposite of hunger, but almost as deadly--can see its destructive nature and pull out of the dive before its diet crashes. Because &#x201c;solving&#x201d; hunger by driving people into cities to take low-paying jobs so they can buy burgers and fries is hardly a desirable outcome.<br><br>OCTOBER 14, 2013<br>Sustainable Farming Can Feed the World<br><br>The oldest and most common dig against organic agriculture is that it cannot feed the world&#x2019;s citizens; this, however, is a supposition, not a fact. And industrial agriculture isn&#x2019;t working perfectly, either: the global food price index is at a record high, and our agricultural system is wreaking havoc with the health not only of humans but of the earth. There are around a billion undernourished people; we can also thank the current system for the billion who are overweight or obese.<br><br>Yet there is good news: increasing numbers of scientists, policy panels, and experts (not hippies!) are suggesting that agricultural practices pretty close to organic--perhaps best called &#x201c;sustainable&#x201d;--can feed more poor people sooner, begin to repair the damage caused by industrial production, and, in the long term, become the norm.<br><br>Olivier de Schutter, the United Nations&#x2019; special rapporteur on the Right to Food, is the author of a report entitled &#x201c;Agro-ecology and the Right to Food.&#x201d; (Agro-ecology, he explained to me, has &#x201c;lots&#x201d; in common with both &#x201c;sustainable&#x201d; and &#x201c;organic.&#x201d;) Chief among de Schutter&#x2019;s recommendations is this: &#x201c;Agriculture should be fundamentally redirected towards modes of production that are more environmentally sustainable and socially just.&#x201d; Agro-ecology, he said, immediately helps &#x201c;small farmers who must be able to farm in ways that are less expensive and more productive. But it benefits all of us, because it decelerates global warming and ecological destruction.&#x201d; Further, by decentralizing production, floods in Southeast Asia, for example, might not mean huge shortfalls in the world&#x2019;s rice crop; smaller scale farming makes the system less susceptible to climate shocks. (Calling it a system is a convention; it&#x2019;s actually quite anarchic, what with all these starving and overweight people canceling each other out.)<br><br>Industrial (or &#x201c;conventional,&#x201d; even though by most standards it&#x2019;s anything but) agriculture requires a great deal of resources, including disproportionate amounts of water and the fossil fuel that&#x2019;s needed for transportation, to make chemical fertilizer, mechanize working the land and its crops, run irrigation sources, and heat buildings and crop dryers. This means it needs more in the way of resources than the earth can replenish. (Fun/depressing fact: It takes the earth 18 months to replenish the amount of resources we use each year. Looked at another way, we&#x2019;d need 1.5 earths to be sustainable at our current rate of consumption.)<br><br>Agro-ecology and related methods are going to require resources too, but they&#x2019;re more in the form of labor, both intellectual--much research remains to be done--and physical: the world will need more farmers, and quite possibly less mechanization. Many adherents rule out nothing, including in their recommendations even GMOs and chemical fertilizers where justifiable. Meanwhile, those working towards improving conventional agriculture are borrowing more from organic methods.<br><br>Currently, however, it&#x2019;s difficult to see progress in a country where, for example, nearly 90 percent of the corn crop is used for either ethanol (40 percent) or animal feed (50 percent). And most of the diehard adherents of industrial agriculture--sadly, this usually includes Congress, which largely ignores these issues--act as if we&#x2019;ll somehow &#x201c;fix&#x201d; global warming and the resulting climate change. (The small percentage of climate-change deniers are still arguing with Copernicus.) Their assumption is that by increasing supply, we&#x2019;ll eventually figure out how to feed everyone on earth, even though we don&#x2019;t do that now, our population is going to be nine billion by 2050, and more supply of the wrong things--oil, corn, beef--only worsens things. Many seem to naively believe that we won&#x2019;t run out of the resources we need to keep this system going.</p><h2>The Shoes of the Fisherman (Vatican Trilogy, Book 1)</h2><p>A Russian - and the youngest cardinal of all - is elected as the new pope.

The sheriff, Crane Carlson, needs no reminder of this but gets one anyway when he finds a kid not yet twenty murdered in a meth lab.

But as their lives become even more strained, hardship foments exceptional compassion and generosity, and those caught in their own sorrow alleviate the same in others, changing themselves as they do so. In this gripping story, along with harsh truths and difficult consolation come moments of hilarity and surprise and beauty. No one writes more compellingly about the modern West than Mark Spragg, and in <i>Bone Fire </i>he is at the very height of his powers.</p><p><strong> A Q&amp;A with Author Mark Spragg</strong> <br> <br> <b>Question:</b> You&#x2019;ve said that the genesis of <i>Bone Fire</i> started with a series of reoccurring daydreams of Einar Gilkyson tending a huge fire of bones and antlers. Where do you think this particular image came from?<p></p> <p><b>Mark Spragg:</b> I&#x2019;d guess the image emerged from that part of my subconscious that yearns for a sense of completion and comfort and rest. Einar appeared very satisfied in my daydreams, calm in the firelight at the very end of his life but not at all disturbed by the idea of death. I believe it was because of Einar&#x2019;s apparent ease that I began to wonder about all of the old men who must have--through the centuries of human existence--sat in the night warming themselves at a fire, perhaps reflecting about how they&#x2019;d managed with their lives. It was his fearlessness that was initially attractive.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> Bone Fire takes place many years after <i>An Unfinished Life</i>. You&#x2019;ve also said that you didn&#x2019;t intend to write another novel set in Ishawooa, but found that you had to in order to satisfy your curiosities about these people. How did you know you weren&#x2019;t finished with them? And how did you decide to revisit them at this particular moment in their lives?</p> <p><b>Mark Spragg:</b> There was primarily the image of Einar at the fire, but then I became obsessed with Griff, the little girl in <i>An Unfinished Life</i>, wondering about what she might be like as a young woman, and then Paul, the little boy from <i>The Fruit of Stone</i>, wondering about the young man he had become. I was surprised every step of the way that I had so many unanswered questions about the characters from these previous two novels, and that their lives had become so linked together in my imagination. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> Many people have an idealized view of the West as a place that in many ways is frozen in time. Is this something you think about, trying to create a more accurate accounting of it in your work?</p> <p><b>Mark Spragg:</b> It&#x2019;s very natural for me to set my books in the West because it&#x2019;s where I grew up and have lived for most of my adult life. I care for the place enough to try, at the very least, to render it accurately. Idealizing anything--a region, a religion, an individual--strips it of its humanity, and one is left with only parody. So yes, I try my hardest to write the reality of what I know.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> Further to that point, early in this novel Crane Carlson, the sheriff, finds a teenager murdered in a meth lab, a crime he&#x2019;ll continue to investigate throughout the book. Natural beauty and violence seem to intersect in your novels in surprising ways, each really shining a laser-sharp beam on the other. Is that contrast intentional?</p> <p><b>Mark Spragg:</b> The contrast may be more unavoidable than intentional. Certainly, there&#x2019;s violence everywhere, but perhaps in a starker landscape--one-half of Wyoming is owned by the Federal Government in the form of parks and national forests and wilderness areas, and there&#x2019;s quite a lot of deeded land that remains undeveloped--violence appears to be more shocking, strangely more personal.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> Can you talk a little about the relationship between McEban and Kenneth, and where in your life or imagination that relationship comes from? Kenneth is the same age as Griff was in <i>An Unfinished Life</i>. Is it a coincidence that both novels feature a child around the age of ten? How does having a child&#x2019;s perspective feel important to you?</p> <p><b>Mark Spragg:</b> I particularly love children at that age. They&#x2019;re remarkably capable without owning the self-consciousness of adolescence, or the arrogance. They seem to me uncommonly brave and insightful, and even in very bad situations, at ten they still seem hopeful, believing that they might make a difference in the world. There was also the ten-year-old Paul in The Fruit of Stone. So, clearly this is an aspect of human relationship about which I am utterly fascinated. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> Kenneth is a boy in a world of men, much as Einar remembers being as a child. It&#x2019;s a childhood filled with fun, but also one very much about apprenticeship and learning how to become a man. When he&#x2019;s taken out of this world and thrust into a more conventional childhood--the one with iPods and channel surfing--he&#x2019;s miserable. Why did you decide to put him in this situation?</p> <p><b>Mark Spragg:</b> I believe children want to be useful. Further, I believe that each of us yearns to contribute to something grander than ourselves, to become part of a family, a community. This rather modern notion of childhood as an 18-year stretch of unfettered play and irresponsibility was not my experience.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> Of your own childhood, you&#x2019;ve said: "My appetite for quietude, no doubt, has something to do with being raised on a National Forest just off the edge of the Yellowstone Plateau. We couldn&#x2019;t get television or radio reception, and of course the Internet was years away. I was raised with the luck of silence." Could you expand on that particular piece of luck?</p> <p><b>Mark Spragg:</b> More specifically, I was raised without distraction. There were no electronic screens, however large or small, or supposedly informative and essential to my happiness, that I looked to for entertainment or information. There were the people around me, and the natural world, and I was required to be engaged. I was not allowed to be merely a spectator. There was nothing about my boyhood world that was virtual, and I suppose I miss being that completely undistracted in my day-to-day life. </p> <p> (Photo � Virginia Korus Spragg) </p>Mark Spragg is the author of <i>Where Rivers Change Direction,</i> a memoir that won the Mountains &amp; Plains Booksellers Award, and the novels <i>The Fruit of Stone</i> and <i>An Unfinished Life,</i> which was chosen by the <i>Rocky Mountain News</i> as the Best Book of 2004.

On its shores and islands they have built cities, colonised, dreamed, conquered and fallen. This sea, which brings together three continents, was the cradle of western civilisation. Ernle Bradford spent almost 30 years sailing into nearly every corner of the Mediterranean and here he tells its fascinating story. Once it was realised that the sea could be a link rather than a barrier, discovery was possible and he follows the explorations of the Egyptians, the Cretans, the Phoenicians, the Greeks and others. The Mediterranean became a Roman and Byzantine sea until displaced by the Arab and Turkish conquests which reached their apogee with the great siege of Malta in 1565; by the 18th century Europe again dominated, with France and England in contention for sovereignty. The author continues his story through the grand sweep of historic events including the Napoleonic wars, the building of the Suez Canal and on to two World Wars ending with the peace of 1945. Into his account of the history of the region, the author weaves a wealth of detail: of flora and fauna, trade and commerce, society and religion, war and peace. The result is a portrait of an enormously vibrant region and its people.</p><p></p><h2>Clan Novel Nosferatu *OP</h2><p>VtM: Clan Novel - NosferatuWhite WolfAuthor: Gherbod FlemingPages: 286SRP: $5.99ISBN: 1-56504-835-0UPC: 099379111127Lowliest and nost scorned of vampires, the Kindred of Clan Nosferatu know better than most the horrors that lie far beneath the streets.

Justification, he contends, is death and rising, and where these complementary metaphors are allowed to interpret one another the Gospel can once again explode with all its original power. This fresh appropriation of the confessional witness contributes not only to an enhanced understanding of Reformation teachings, but also to an ecumenical dialogue that is zeroing in more closely on the catholic provenance and current vitality of the Augsburg Confession.</p><p>Gerhard O.

Inexpressibly, inhumanly monstrous and absurd. Entirely incompatible with life." That would be an understatement. Yet Victor Pelevin, who's already produced such post-perestroika gems as <i>Omon Ra</i> and <i>The Life of Insects</i>, gets plenty of comic mileage out of Pyotr Voyd's dilemma. He also puts identity, reality, and existence up for grabs, and toys with time and continuity much as Italo Calvino did in his exhilarating <i>If on a Winter's Night a Traveler</i>.<p> A poet from St. Petersburg, Pelevin's hero finds himself caught in a temporal tug of war: on one hand, he's walking a tightrope between Reds and Whites during the Russian Revolution, and on the other, he's floating in and out of the bizarre world of a psychiatric hospital in 1990s Moscow. The revolutionary era does offer Pyotr the occasional boost. His commander, the sly and intellectually provocative comrade Chapaev, tells him that he is a "man of decisive character and at the same time you have a subtle appreciation of the essential nature of events. People like you are in great demand."</p><p> That's not the sense he gets in the hospital, however, where he passes the time kneading lumps of Plasticene and sketching busts of Aristotle. Sharing a room and "turbo-Jungian" therapy sessions with three other nutters, Pyotr is all too easily submerged in their intricate fantasies. Sound complicated? Well, Pelevin offers up these parallel lives in such a kaleidoscopic jumble that it's sometimes easy to get lost. Yet those readers willing to follow the hero in his travails--to make, as it were, a leap into the Voyd--will encounter a hilarious, disturbing, and wildly inventive exploration of reality. <i>--S.

It teaches the principles of self-healing based in true health science. This complete wholistic wellness guide is the culmination of Dr. Klein s 25 years of health experience since healing himself after 8 years of severe ulcerative colitis in 1984, plus his experience with thousands of clients, 99% of whom successfully healed since 1993 via his Colitis &amp; Crohn's Health Recovery Center. Rooted in the Natural Hygiene self-healthcare system, this guide book contains the clear, step-by-step, medically-endorsed diet &amp; wholistic lifestyle program which has conclusively proved to be the definitive natural way to heal IBD &amp; IBS. Disease only occurs if we cause it. IBD &amp; IBS are completely reversible when we remove the causes &amp; live healthfully. This book served as the author's thesis for his Hygienic Doctor degree. It answers virtually every question which has arisen in over 10,000 consultations. Deep, clearly-written chapters explain the purpose of disease, &amp; how to heal &amp; maintain a lifetime of vibrant health. It accurately explains the many factors and primary cause of inflammatory bowel disease and ulcers: toxic, acidifying, undigestible diets. It presents a naturally liberating dietary healing plan based upon true health science, grounded in physiology. The book explains that inflammation and ulcerations are heightened self-purification / self-healing actions conducted by the body in response to an overload of dietary toxins in the bloodstream, tissues &amp; bowel. It addresses the many factors that may contribute to bowel inflammation &amp; ulcers, &amp; shows how IBD, IBS and any digestive disorder can be permanently overcome via proven dietary and health-promoting lifestyle practices in line with our natural biological mandates. The 100% effective Vegan Diet Healing Plan teaches step-by-step how to eat for rapid healing &amp; long lasting health. It is described in great detail with clear guidelines. It removes the toxic dietary factors which have been proven to cause all forms of IBD, and implements our natural, biologically-correct, most nutritious, purifying, easy-to-digest &amp; healthful diet with a healing &amp; health-promoting program of rest, extra sleep, detoxification, internal cleanliness, emotional release, positive thinking, exercise &amp; other natural lifestyle practices for the restoration &amp; preservation of health. It provides an extensive list of the toxic, indigestible, inflammation-causing foods &amp; other pitfalls to avoid. Countless people have thrived on this Natural Hygiene program for decades. After thousands of clinical cases, the author &amp; several other Medical &amp; Hygienic Doctors have concluded that this natural Hygienic approach is the only true way to heal and keep healthy because it is based on an accurate understanding of human physiology &amp; our biological requisites for health. It involves no medicines, treatments or products; the body is a self-healing organism and it does its healing work perfectly when he provide the conditions for healing. This information saved the author's colon and life in 1984 after suffering with advance ulcerative colitis for 8 years &amp; a colostomy was recommended. Thousands have permanently overcome inflammatory bowel illness by following this plan. The author, a Hygienic Doctor, has personally guided over 1,000 clients to disease-free health. The book was endorsed by 4 medical doctors including 1 gastroenterologist who works with Dr. Klein. This is not a plan for managing IBD and IBS, a quick-fix gimmick that works for only some people, or a program that the author invented based upon unproven theories. Instead, it is based upon factual principles of health science teaching us how to remove the causes of IBD and IBS, fully unleash our self-healing powers &amp; promote lasting wellness.</p><p>Dr. David Klein has been Director of the Colitis &amp; Crohn s Health Recovery Center, currently located in Sebastopol in northern California, since 1993.

Dr. Klein's own unique healing journey, his studies of many disciplines of health science, and his extensive professional experience have given him uncommon insight into the requisites of healing and health, by which he is able to consistently guide people from disease to rejuvenation. Self Healing Colitis &amp; Crohn's served as Dr. Klein's thesis for his Ph.D. Dr. Klein is also Editor of Vibrance magazine, the world s most-read raw food health lifestyle magazine. Dr. Klein is also a Professor with the new University of Natural Health. Dr. Klein book Your Natural Diet: Alive Raw Foods is the text for the course Humans Natural Biological Diet.

He has led many natural health seminars over the last 10 years and co-produced health festivals in northern California. Dr. Klein has thrived on a 100 percent vegan diet of mostly raw foods since 1984. Originally from New Jersey, he also holds a B.S. in civil engineering and worked 10 years in the field of environmental engineering before starting his health education businesses and practice. Leading people to health independence is Dr. Klein's passion.Dr. David Klein's Self Healing Colitis &amp; Crohn's demystifies the secrets of the innate natural health processes, by which the body possesses the power to heal itself. A Hygienic Doctor and former victim of ulcerative colitis, Dr. Klein is the leading modern-day pioneer and authority on the self-healing principles of Colitis and Crohn's disease. He is living proof that the body can cure itself and maintain its natural, pristine health when the causes of disease are removed, and it is allowed to perform its magical healing-dance of life. -Paul Fanny, Ph.D., H.D., President of the University of Natural Health --Book endorsement<br><br>Over years of practice I have observed the pain and suffering of my colitis patients who are on conventional medical therapy. High dosages of immunosuppressants, such as prednisone and like products, are commonly given, resulting in effects ranging from serious to life-threatening.

I was very impressed with David's Natural Hygiene approach to healing ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, outlined in his book, Self Healing Colitis &amp; Crohn's. Healthy since 1984 after a severe 8-year bout with ulcerative colitis, he himself is living proof that his program works. I support his approach 100% and believe it is the only way to healing of colitis and almost all other health problems, and, therefore, I recommend it to every one of my clients.

Busy cooks can save time using hundreds of creative tips designed to get the most flavor with the least effort. Reflecting the cultural diversity and fresh local ingredients that define Northern California, it's no wonder that even New York City looks to the West Coast and the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> food section to discover exciting, new culinary trends.</p><p>Even hard-core New York foodies know that San Francisco is the epicenter of food trends. New York may grow trends, but they are born in the City by the Bay. In San Francisco, food is more than just fuel, it's a lifestyle. With the top wines in the nation produced less than an hour away, the country's best produce grown at its doorstep, the myriad cultural influences from around the globe, and the abundance of artisan producers of bread, cheese, and other culinary delights, it's no wonder that Bay Area diners and home cooks are so food savvy. Their home is truly a culinary mecca.<p> This passion for good food means that readers of the city's preeminent daily newspaper, <i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>, are destined to demand an equally savvy and intriguing food section that celebrates the abundance and diversity of its home town. Sure enough, the <i>Chronicle</i> food section is known for its fresh, inventive recipes.</p><p> <i>The San Francisco Chronicle Cookbook, Vol. 2</i>, edited by <i>Chronicle</i> food section editors Michael Bauer and Fran Irwin, collects 375 of the best recipes from world-renowned chefs and food writers including Paul Bertolli, Marion Cunningham, Mark Franz, Marlena Spieler, Flo Baker, and many others. Just a quick glance through this fat volume--the much-awaited sequel to the popular <i>volume one</i>--gives readers a sense of the sheer diversity of the recipes included. Appetizers range from a traditional French Provencal appetizer of Creamy Brandade of Salt Cod and Potatoes with Garlic Croutons to Shrimp Crostini with Thai Basil and Kaffir Lime Leaf to Libyan Spicy Pumpkin Dip; entrees from the meatless Malaysian Curry of Autumn Vegetables to Pan-Grilled Steaks with Toasted Walnuts and Roquefort-Shallot Butter to Grilled Tequila Chipotle Shrimp.

Sevich, the priest from the old country</p><p>Grimscribe: His Lives and Works is the second volume in a series of revised, definitive editions of the horror story collections of Thomas Ligotti. First published in 1991 by Carroll &amp; Graf in the United States and Robinson Publishing in England, Grimscribe garnered significantly more recognition than Ligotti's first collection, Songs of a Dead Dreamer, which was issued two years earlier by the same publishers.In the view of many commentators, it was with Grimscribe that Ligotti consolidated his reputation as a horror writer of high stature. As Steven J. Mariconda remarked in a 1992 essay surveying the stories in Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe: &#x201c;Of the two collections, Grimscribe achieves near-classic status and is recommended to all.&#x201d; Included in this volume is &#x201c;The Last Feast of Harlequin,&#x201d; a novella that, in the observation of H. P. Lovecraft scholar and biographer S. T. Joshi, &#x201c;may perhaps be the very best homage to Lovecraft ever written.&#x201d; Like the stories in Songs of a Dead Dreamer, the first title of Ligotti's to be published in a revised, definitive edition by Subterranean Press, those presented here in Grimscribe: His Lives and Works have been amended to realize the full artistic aims of the originals rather than to compose new versions of these works. This volume may thus be considered, in the manner of its predecessor in this series, as both as a reissue and the culminating specimen of its master effort of twenty years ago.High-style horror stories in a classic literary mode, in expressiveness not far from the American masters, Poe and H.P. Lovecraft. Ligotti (Songs of a Dead Dreamer, 1990) writes out of what seems an all-embracing depression, making him willing to go into wipeout areas time and again and ask a lot both of himself and his readers. His narrators seldom effect any change; they simply observe a superbly described inner state, then leave, hungover. In ``The Last Feast of Harlequin,'' a professor obsessed with clowns locates a clown festival in the midwestern town of Mirocaw. He goes to observe and join the townsfolk in their festival, perhaps wearing his clown suit. But the festival is not meant for him. In fact, it is two festivals, one within the other, the inner one being a cruel festival of freaks who are detested and beaten by members of the larger clown festival. He joins the freaks and follows them out of town and down a hole in the earth wherein they have borne their frigid Winter Queen. In a cavernous earthen hall, the freaks begin turning into huge worms, and he flees up the black wormhole by which he entered. In ``The Glamour,'' the narrator enters a weird boarded-up movie house to find himself in a sparse audience surrounded by purple lights and seated amid hairy threads that bind all to their seats as they watch a cobweb screen on which is shown grisly purple organs being operated on. He leaves before he can be imprisoned by the floating and crawling hairs. In ``The Night School,'' he enters a dark, weird schoolground where strange figures stand around misshapen metal drums in firelight; then he goes into the hideously rotting school for a bizarre class in ``measurement of cloacal forces. Time as a flow of sewage. The excrement of space, scatology of creation...'' He leaves, finding the moon ``coated with a luminous mold, floating...in the great sewers of the night.''

"There is no doubt that if one compares these shoe prints with the photographs of the footprints taken at the scene of the murder, one would be led to the conclusion that they were made by the same pair of shoes." Photographs of the footprints and the corresponding shoe prints were laid out on the table in front of him.Li Yan nodded cautiously, uncertain where this was leading, aware of the judge watching him closely from the bench opposite, a wily, white-haired veteran languishing thoughtfully in his winter blue uniform beneath the red, blue, and gold crest of the Ministry of Public Security. The scribble of the clerk's pen was clearly audible in the silence of the packed courtroom."Which would further lead one to the conclusion that the owner of these shoes was, at the very least, present at the crime scene--particularly in light of the prosecution's claim that tracesof the victim's blood were also found on the shoes." The lawyer looked up from his table and fixed Li with a cold stare. He was a young man, in his early thirties, about the same age as Li, one of a new breed of lawyers feeding off the recent raft of legislation regulating the burgeoning Chinese justice system. He was sleek, well-groomed, prosperous. A dark Armani suit, a crisp white, button-down designer shirt and silk tie. And he was brimming with a self-confidence that made Li uneasy. "Would you agree?"Li nodded."I'm sorry, did you speak?""No, I nodded my agreement." Irritation in Li's voice."Then please speak up, Deputy Section Chief, so that the clerk can note your comments for the record." The Armani suit's tone was condescending, providing the court with the erroneous impression that the police officer in the witness stand was a rank novice.Li bristled. This was a cut-and-dried case. The defendant had come in from the countryside claiming to be looking for work in Beijing. He had broken into a home in the northeast of the city, and when the occupant, an elderly widow, had startled him, had stabbed her to death. There had been copious amounts of blood. The next day the warden at a workers' hostel had called the local public security bureau to report that one of his residents had returned in the middle of the night covered in what looked like blood. By the time the police got there, the defendant had somehow managed to dispose of his bloodstained clothes and showered himself clean. No murder weapon was recovered, but a pair of his shoes matched prints left in blood at the scene, and forensics found traces of the victim's blood in the treads. Li wondered why this supercilious defense lawyer seemed so confident. He didn't have to wait long to find out."You would further agree, then, that the owner of these shoes was most probably the perpetrator of the crime.""I would." Li spoke clearly, so that there could be no ambiguity."So what leads you to believe that my client was the perpetrator?"Li frowned. "They're his shoes.""Are they?""They were found in his room at the hostel. Forensic examinationfound traces of the victim's blood in the treads, and footwear impressions taken from them provided an exact match with the prints found at the scene.""So where are they?" The lawyer's eyes held Li in their unwavering gaze.For the first time Li's own confidence began to falter. "Where are what?""The shoes." This delivered with an affected weariness. "You can't claim to have found a pair of shoes in my client's room tying him to a crime scene and then fail to produce them as evidence."Li felt a hot flush rising on his cheeks. He glanced toward the procurator's table, but the prosecutor's eyes were firmly fixed on papers in front of him. "After forensics had finished with them, they were logged and tagged and--""I ask again," the lawyer interrupted, raising his voice, a voice of reason asking a not unreasonable question. "Where are they?""They were sent down to the procurator's office as exhibits for the court.""Then why are they not here for us all to see?"Li glanced at the procurator again, only this time it was anger that colored his face. Clearly the prosecution's failure to produce the shoes had been well aired before Li had even been called to give evidence. He was being made to look like an idiot. "Why don't you ask the procurator?" His voice was taut with tension."I already did. He says that his office never received them from your office."A hubbub of excited speculation buzzed around the public benches. The clerk issued a curt warning for members of the public to remain silent or be expelled from the court. Li knew perfectly well that the shoes, along with all the other evidence, had been dispatched to the procurator's office. But he also knew that there was nothing he could say or do here in the witness box that could prove it. He felt every eye in the court upon him."Surely, Deputy Section Chief, it must be obvious even to you, that without the shoes my client has no case to answer?"Li closed his eyes and breathed deeply.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Through glass doors, past a row of potted plants, Li started angrily down the steps toward the car park. The procurator chased after him, clutching a thick folder of documents. Above them rose the five stories of Central Beijing Middle Court. To their left, armed officers guarded the vehicle entrance to the holding cells, and a red Chinese flag hung limp in the winter sun over the Ministry of Public Security's crest of justice. Justice! Li thought not. He pulled on a greatcoat over his green uniform and hauled a peaked cap down over his flattop crew cut. His breath billowed before him like dragon fire in the cold morning air."I'm telling you, we never got them." The procurator was a short, spindly man with thinning hair and thick glasses. His uniform was too large for him."Bullshit!" Li wheeled around on the steps and the procurator came to an abrupt halt on the step above. Li still towered over him. "You would never have brought the case to court if we hadn't provided the evidence.""Paper evidence. That's all you sent me. I assumed the shoes had been lodged in the evidence depository.""They were. Which makes them your responsibility, not ours." Li raised his arms with his voice, and people flooding out of the court behind them stopped to listen. "In the name of the sky, Zhang! My people work their butts off to bring criminals to justice ..." He was distracted momentarily by the sight of the Armani suit and his exultant client passing them on the steps. He had a powerful urge to take his fist and smash their gloating faces to a pulp. But he turned instead to vent his anger on the procurator. "And you fucking people go losing the evidence and let killers walk free. Expect an official complaint." He clamped a cigarette in his mouth and headed off down the steps. Procurator Zhang was fuming and only too aware of curious faces watching him. Policemen did not speak to procurators like that. Certainly not in public. It was a humiliating loss of face."I'm the one who'll be making the complaint, Deputy Section Chief," Zhang shouted lamely at Li's back. "To the commissioner. You needn't think you can live in the protective shadow of your uncle forever."Li stopped and turned, fixing him with a silent stare filled withsuch intensity that Zhang could not maintain eye contact. He knew he had gone too far and ran back up the steps into the safety of the courthouse.Li stared after him for a few moments, then hurried through the parked vehicles to the street, still fighting his anger. A group of people standing at the notice board where the week's trials were posted in advance turned to watch as he strode past. But he didn't notice them. Neither did he see the vendor at the corner of the street offering him fruit from under a green and yellow striped awning. Nor did he smell the smoke rising from lamb skewers cooking on open coals in the narrow confines of Xidamochang Street. He turned toward the roar of traffic on East Qianmen Avenue, ignoring the honk of a car's horn sounding behind him. Only when its engine revved and the horn sounded again did he half turn. An unmarked Beijing Police jeep drew alongside him. Detective Wu leaned over to push open the passenger door. Li was not pleased to see him. "What d'you want, Wu?"Wu raised his hands in mock defense. "Hey, boss, I've been waiting for you for over an hour."Li hesitated briefly before slipping into the passenger seat. "What for?"Wu grinned, jaws grinding on a piece of leathery gum that had long since lost its flavor. He pushed his sunglasses up on his forehead. He was the bearer of interesting news, and he wanted to make the most of it. "Remember that case during Spring Festival? The dismembered girl? We found her bits in a shallow grave out near the Summer Palace?""Yeah, I remember the case. We never got anyone for it." Li paused. "What about it?""They found a whole lot more just like her down in Shanghai. Some kind of mass grave. Maybe as many as twenty. Same MO.""Twenty!" Li was shocked.Wu shrugged. "They don't know for sure yet, but there are lots of bits. And they want you down there. Fast."Li was taken aback. "Me? Why?"Wu grinned. "'Cause you're such a fucking superstar, boss." But his smile froze quickly in the chill of Li's glare. "They thinkthere could be a link to the murder here in Beijing. And there's big pressure to get a result fast on this one.""Why's that?" Li had already forgotten his courtroom debacle.Wu lit a cigarette. "Seems there was this big ceremony down there this morning.

From August 1916 almost until the armistice in November 1918, Ludendorff led the Imperial German army to victory over the new Soviet Union and to crushing defeat at the hands of the Western Allies and the United States. A brilliant tactician and an abysmally poor politician and strategist, Ludendorff summed up the strengths and weaknesses of the German General Staff. After the war, he was instrumental in propagating the myth that Germany was undefeated (the "stab-in-the-back legend"), wrote the first book extolling "total war," briefly aided Hitler&#x2019;s new Nazi movement, and then drifted ever further into the haze of rightwing conspiracy theories that poisoned the Weimar Republic.

In a career beginning shortly after she graduated from Gettysburg College in 1970, Springer wrote for ten years in the imaginary realms of mythological fantasy, then ventured on contemporary fantasy, magical realism, and women's fiction before turning her attention to children's literature. Her novels and stories for middle-grade and young adults range from contemporary realism, mystery/crime, and fantasy to her critically acclaimed novels based on the Arthurian mythos, I AM MORDRED: A TALE OF CAMELOT and I AM MORGAN LE FAY. Springer's children's books have won her two Edgar Allan Poe awards, a Carolyn W. Field award, various Children's Choice honors and numerous ALA Best Book listings. Her most recent series include the Tales of Rowan Hood, featuring Robin Hood&#x2019;s daughter, and the Enola Holmes mysteries, starring the much younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.<p> Ms. Springer lives in East Berlin, Pennsylvania. </p>Grade 5-8&#x2013;Rook, another member of the band of Sherwood Forest outlaws from the author's "Rowan Hood" series (Philomel), faces more than one kind of demon and deals with a dark internal struggle. Orphaned when one of the Sheriff of Nottingham's man traps kills his father, the young man carries bitterness and hatred within and compares himself to the wild wolves that roam free and answer to no one, though he can't quite bring himself to separate from Rowan's band. When a man trap catches the Sheriff's son and Rook finds him, he must decide whether to leave Tod to die in revenge or to help him. His choice sets in motion a chain of events that brings Rook out of the darkness and breaks the stone wall around his heart. Tod, too, faces truths about his evil father and literally rides off into the sunrise a changed man on an adventure of self-discovery. More psychological in nature than the other books in the series, the story nonetheless offers adventure and suspense. The rich, descriptive language and the humor will engage readers as well. Though the novel is short, Springer masterfully develops Rook's character and makes him someone with whom readers will empathize. Fans of the series won't be disappointed, and newcomers should be able to follow the story line as well.<i>&#x2013;Cheri Dobbs, Detroit Country Day Middle School, Beverly Hills, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book is one of the few at the present time to offer a global synthesis of the main themes in the sacramental mystery in which the human and divine, the material and the spiritual realms are intimately intertwined. Paul Haffner outlines how the sacraments are the chief means in the Church through which God&#39;s people are reconciled to the Father, through His Son, by the power of the Holy Spirit. The book illustrates classical issues like the conditions for the validity and the efficacy of the sacraments, as well as the minister, recipient and effects of these sacred mysteries; it deals with particular topics like the necessity of Baptism, the sacrificial character of the Eucharist, and the nature of marriage. As he examines each sacrament in turn, the author also explores how new ecumenical questions affect Christian sacramental understanding. &#39;I warmly commend this work on the subject of sacramental theology&#39; Archbishop Csaba Ternyak Secretary of the Vatican Congregation of the Clergy Paul Haffner is lecturer in systematic and dogmatic theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University, the Pontifical Lateran University, the Pontifical Athenaeum &#39;Regina Apostolorum&#39; and the Pontifical Institute &#39;Regina Mundi&#39; in Rome.

S. Sebald, Louise Glu�ck, and many more. Throughout he celebrates the renegade spirit, whether it inspires a rogue ant to depart from his prescribed path or a poet to write unfashionably honest verse.Simic brings the personal worlds of each writer and artist to life, discussing their friends, homes, influences, and the rooms that shaped their outlooks. His portraits urge the reader to regard writers and artists as protean, fallible men and women rather than as immutable icons, and he reveals the key turning points in the creative lives of his subjects, noting their creative failures as often as he does their successes. He is unflinching in his analyses of even the most beloved cultural figures, following his enthralling praises with unforgettable, piercing critiques.3 illustrations</p><p>Charles Simic was born in Belgrade. He is a United States Poet Laureate, an essayist and translator. His 1990 collection, The World Doesn&#39;t End: Prose Poems was awarded the Pulitzer Prize. He lives in New Hampshire.U.S. poet laureate Simic casts his knowing eye over a range of subjects in 16 biographical/critical pieces, many originally published in the <i>New York Review of Books</i> and other journals. In the opening, autobiographical piece, Simic, born in 1938, recalls his Belgrade, Yugoslavia, childhood unsentimentally (I had a happy childhood despite droning planes, deafening explosions, and people hung from lampposts. I mean, it's not like I knew better....), and continues with his arrival in America as a teenager and how his growing distaste for Serbian nationalism turned him into a renegade. Simic then roves outward to figures such as the misunderstood and underappreciated E.A. Robinson; melancholy Robert Creeley of <i>Black Mountain Review</i> fame; surrealist-inspired Yves Bonnefoy; and fellow U.S. poet laureate Donald Hall. He examines the endless quirks of Witold Gombrowicz, the eclectic originality of W.G. Sebald and certainly one of the greatest artistic renegades anywhere, Christopher Marlowe. Also among these elegant, penetrating writings are essays on a MoMA exhibit of Dada and on Whitman, not to mention a memorable segue on the world's worst haircut. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

National ad/promo.</p><p>Powers's fourth novel (Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up?, 1975, is his best known) is a 1950's coming-of-age saga about a boy who loses his brother in an accident. Its bittersweet nostalgia is amiably comic most of the way through. Donald Cooper returns to the neighborhood where he grew up--on the South Side of Chicago--when his mother, a widow, breaks her hip. The narrative then seesaws between the present and the past that comes to haunt Donald. His mother was a housewife and his father drove a delivery truck at a time when the nuclear family was celebrated not for its dysfunctions but for its wholesome American flavor. And Donald, who in the present is recovering from lung- cancer surgery, remembers it mostly that way: brother Danny playing the trumpet, lemonade on the front porch, trips to the corner store, the crosstown rivalry between the White Sox and the Cubs. The story jump-cuts between years and instances, between Donald and Danny, between the usual crises and illnesses of childhood, providing nostalgia by way of 16-inch softball (``Many a Chicagoan has spent virtually every warm evening hour of his life playing sixteen-inch softball'') and high jinks by way of puberty (``About every ten minutes I'd have this urge to gangbang Europe'') and a mother who ``goes through the motions of tucking us in,'' no matter how old the boys became. Finally, however, after a series of instances involving the family car, Danny borrows it one night and is killed in a car wreck, whereupon the story turns suitably melancholy before finishing with an aching description of autumn and a relatively upbeat ending. Portions of the novel were originally presented in a one-man show. While the prose style is not particularly distinguished, the material has enough psychic weight and nuclear-family ambiance to deserve attention. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this quip-packed novel from the author of Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect Up? , narrator Donald Cooper, a divorced father and gag writer in L.A., reassesses his life and finally comes of age. Donald is gloomy: the results of his lung biopsy are pending, his girlfriend has just stormed out of the apartment, it's his 45th birthday and no well-wishers have called--not even his elderly mother back in Chicago. Donald himself has avoided his hometown since his younger brother's death 25 years ago. But when he learns that his mother has been hospitalized after a fall, he rushes to her bedside. She persuades him to retrieve some items from the house where he grew up, and returning there allows him to begin a protracted eulogy to Danny, who died at 18. In no particular order, he recalls baseball games, family dinners, holidays and dating, telling how Danny, his closest friend, shrugged off competition though he was a natural at sports and easily won girls over with his mature sensitivity. Powers based this novel on a one-man show, Scissors, Paper, Rock , in which he toured the country in 1989; reading it is like watching a series of home movies. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My World (Adventures in Time and Place)</h2><p>Hardcover Macmillan McGraw-Hill MY WORLD Adventures In Time and Place Grade 1 Student Textbook.</p><p></p><h2>My Dear Hamilton: A Novel of Eliza Schuyler Hamilton</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Not since I read Erik Larson&#x2019;s <em>Dead Wake</em> have I had such an edge-of-my-seat immersion into historical events. . . .

A pioneer of great children's literature, Ruth Krausspublished more than thirty books for children during a career that spanned forty years. Krauss and Sendak collaborated on eight books, and we are delighted to reintroduce four of these gems in brand-new editions, together with a favorite Maurice Sendak picture book.</p></p><p><p>Ruth Krauss's beloved picture books include two Caldecott Honor Books, <em>The Happy Day</em>, illustrated by Marc Simont, and <em>A Very Special House</em>, illustrated by Maurice Sendak, as well as the perennial favorite <em>A Hole is to Dig</em>, also illustrated by Mr. Sendak.</p>Now in its second season, HarperCollins's reissue of 22 Sendak classics continues. This time, his collaborations with Ruth Krauss take center stage. In Charlotte and the White Horse, first published in 1955, creamy pages frame Sendak's softly lit illustrations of a girl who convinces her father to keep a wobbly legged horse and cares for him until he can stand on his own. Sendak's delicate watercolors suit the dream-like mood of a boy who accomplishes all that he sets out to do in his imaginary world, in I Want to Paint My Bathroom Blue (1956), also by Krauss. A boy's imagination also comes to the fore in A Very Special House (1953) by Krauss, as the artist depicts the hero creating a home filled with a turtle, a giant, a very old lion and "some monkeys and some skunkeys." Oversize pages brim with the creatures as well as his house's "very special" furnishings. Open House for Butterflies (1960) takes a similar format to these collaborators' classic A Hole Is to Dig, and lastly, Hector Protector and As I Went Over the Water: Two Nursery Rhymes (1965) by Sendak conveys as much plot through the artist's wordless spreads as with the minimal text.

A riotous and explosive mixture of joys and frustrations, Tropic of Capricorn chronicles Miller&#39;s early life in New York, from his repressive Brooklyn childhood spent amongst &#39;a galaxy of screwballs&#39; to frantic, hilarious years of dead-end jobs and innumerable erotic adventures. Irreverent and ironic, Tropic of Capricorn is both a comic portrait of the irrepressible Miller himself and a scathing attack on respectable America, the very foundations of which he hoped to shatter. Publication of Tropic of Capricorn and its sister-volume Tropic of Cancer in Paris in the 1930s was hailed by Samuel Beckett as &#39;a momentous event in the history of modern writing&#39;. The books were subsequently banned in the UK and the USA for nearly thirty years.</p><p><br>Henry Valentine Miller was born in 1891 in New York City and spent most of his life in Brooklyn, Paris, and Big Sur, California. His books include Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn, the Rosy Crucifixion trilogy (Sexus, Plexus, and Nexus), Black Spring, and Crazy Cock. He died in 1980.Campbell Scott might possibly be a narrative dead-ringer for the eponymous protagonist in Henry Miller&#39;s semi-autobiographical TROPIC OF CAPRICORN. Scott&#39;s dry, languorous, and lovely voice, which he uses for most of this book, hits all of Miller&#39;s cynical but observant notes as he describes the great muddle and mess of humanity around him in New York City during the 1920s. Most of the time Scott sounds almost apathetic, mimicking the distant, disenchanted tone of Miller. Yet, besides all the derogatory adjectives that can be thrown at Miller--misogynist, misanthrope, depressed artist--the writer was also ebullient, mystical, and euphoric. Scott, however, captures this side of Miller barely at all, to the detriment of this production. R.L.G. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Who Built the Moon?</h2><p>Brand New.

Yet while few other modern detectives will chase a Rolls Royce down a country lane in an ancient Cortina, Priest does get results. When he&#x2019;s not putting crooks behind bars, he&#x2019;s watching out for his team of young constables, only too aware that for them as much as for him the knock about humor of the station is in stark contrast to the dangers they face on the beat. Sheep steeling and shoplifting are everyday crimes in Heckley, but there are local villains with bigger fish to fry. When Charlie suspects a now-respected businessman, with a background of extortion and GBH, of involvement in an international art fraud, he's taking on an enemy with friends in high places. But Charlie can be persistent to the point of recklessness&#x2014;and, once he's realized that there's a link to the lethal doctored heroin that's striking down the local kids, no threat will stop him...</p><p>STUART PAWSON had a career as a mining engineer, followed by a spell working for the probation service, before he became a full-time writer.

Steven Roger Fischer offers the first English-language history of Easter Island in <i>Island at the End of the World</i>, a fascinating chronicle of adversity, triumph, and the enduring monumentality of the island's stone guards. <br><br>A small canoe with Polynesians brought the first humans to Easter Island in 700 CE, and when boat travel in the South Pacific drastically decreased around 1500, the Easter Islanders were forced to adapt in order to survive their isolation. Adaptation, Fischer asserts,&nbsp;was a continuous thread in the life of Easter Island: the first European visitors, who viewed the awe-inspiring monolithic busts in 1722, set off hundreds of years of violent warfare, trade, and disease&#x2014;from the smallpox, wars, and Great Death that decimated the island to the late nineteenth-century Catholic missionaries who tried to "save" it to a despotic Frenchman who declared sole claim of the island and was soon killed by the remaining 111 islanders. The rituals, leaders, and religions of the Easter Islanders evolved with all of these events, and Fischer is just as attentive to the island's cultural developments as he is to its foreign invasions. <br><br>Bringing his history into the modern era, Fischer examines the colonization and annexation of Easter Island by Chile, including the Rapanui people's push for&nbsp;civil rights in 1964 and 1965, by which they gained full citizenship and freedom of movement on the island. As travel to and interest in the island rapidly expand, <i>Island at the End of the World</i> is an essential history of this mysterious site.</p><p><b>Steven Roger Fischer </b>is director of the Institute of Polynesian Languages and Literatures in Auckland, New Zealand.

From the arrival of a penguin at the Popper home through the household's adjustments to the formation of Popper's Performing Penguin touring show, the key episodes of the original receive hasty--needfully abridged--treatment. Despite the condensation, a great deal of text crowds the pages, lessening the book's fascination for younger readers. Older readers, on the other hand, will probably not be impressed with the paper engineering. Most of it lacks sophistication (pull a tab, and a penguin flaps its wing or sleds down a hill); in some places it's just silly (one pull-tab makes a penguin descend a slide--but only halfway). At no point, however, do the illustrations sustain the amount of text. Stick with the real thing.

We were north of the Arctic Circle on a road made of ice -- not pavement or gravel like a regular road, just a bumpy surface of frozen water. Under the ice flowed dangerous waters, deep enough to drown in -- if the shocking cold didn't kill you first.

You're along for the ride as he befriends a trucker's dog, views the Northern Lights, gets caught in a whiteout, and explores the ice roads of the Far North. Short sidebars of information that accompany Andy's story reveal what's inside a truck's cab, why camels once carried goods through this part of North America, what kids love about live in the Arctic, and much more. Colourful maps (essential traveler's tools) help you follow Andy's route chapter by chapter! </p></p><p><p> <b>Andy Turnbull</b> is a writer and photographer who frequently travels with truckers while on assignment through-out the world.

Why do you still feel fat after losing weight? What makes video games so addictive? How can &#x201c;practicing&#x201d; your favorite sport in your imagination improve your game? The answers can be found in body maps.<br><br>Just as road maps represent interconnections across the landscape, your many body maps represent all aspects of your bodily self, inside and out. In concert, they create your physical and emotional awareness and your sense of being a whole, feeling self in a larger social world.<br><br>Moreover, your body maps are profoundly elastic. Your self doesn&#x2019;t begin and end with your physical body but extends into the space around you. This space morphs every time you put on or take off clothes, ride a bike, or wield a tool. When you drive a car, your personal body space grows to envelop it. When you play a video game, your body maps automatically track and emulate the actions of your character onscreen. When you watch a scary movie, your body maps put dread in your stomach and send chills down your spine. If your body maps fall out of sync, you may have an out-of-body experience or see auras around other people.<br><i><br>The Body Has a Mind of Its Own </i>explains how you can tap into the power of body maps to do almost anything better&#x2013;whether it is playing tennis, strumming a guitar, riding a horse, dancing a waltz, empathizing with a friend, raising children, or coping with stress. <br><br>The story of body maps goes even further, providing a fresh look at the causes of anorexia, bulimia, obsessive plastic surgery, and the notorious golfer&#x2019;s curse &#x201c;the yips.&#x201d; It lends insights into culture, language, music,<b> </b>parenting, emotions, chronic pain, and more. <br><br>Filled with illustrations, wonderful anecdotes, and even parlor tricks that you can use to reconfigure your body sense, <i>The Body Has a Mind of Its Own</i> will change the way you think&#x2013;about the way you think.<br><br>&#x201c;The Blakeslees have taken the latest and most exciting finds from brain research and have made them accessible.

This is his first book.From the Introduction:<br>Stand up and reach out your arms, fingers extended. Wave them up, down, and sideways. Make great big circles from over your head down past your thighs. Swing each leg out as far as you can, and with the tips of your toes trace arcs on the ground around you. Swivel and tilt your head as if you were craning out your neck to butt something with your forehead or touch it with your lips and tongue. This invisible volume of space around your body out to arm&#x2019;s length&#x2014;what neuroscientists call peripersonal space- is part of you.<br><br>This is not a metaphor, but a recently discovered physiological fact. Through a special mapping procedure, your brain annexes this space to your limbs and body, clothing you in it like an extended, ghostly skin. The maps that encode your physical body are connected directly, immediately, personally to a map of every point in that space and also map out your potential to perform actions in that space. Your self does not end where your flesh ends, but suffuses and blends with the world, including other beings. Thus when you ride a horse with confidence and skill, your body maps and the horse&#x2019;s body maps are blended in shared space. When you make love, your body maps and your lover&#x2019;s body maps commingle in mutual passion.<br><br>Your brain also faithfully maps the space beyond your body when you enter it using tools. Take hold of a long stick and tap it on the ground. As far as your brain is concerned, your hand now extends to the tip of that stick. Its length has been annexed to your personal space. If you were blind, you could feel your way down the street using that stick.<br><br> From Chapter 1: <br>The idea that your brain maps chart not only your body but the space around your body, that these maps expand and contract to include every-day objects, and even that these maps can be shaped by the culture you grow up in, is very new to science. Research now shows that your brain is teeming with body maps&#x2014;maps of your body&#x2019;s surface, its musculature, its intentions, its potential for action, even a map that automatically tracks and emulates the actions and intentions of other people around you.<br>These body-centered maps are profoundly plastic&#x2014;capable of significant reorganization in response to damage, experience, or practice. Formed early in life, they mature with experience and then continue to change, albeit less rapidly, for the rest of your life. Yet despite how central these body maps are to your being, you are only glancingly aware of your own embodiment most of the time, let alone the fact that its parameters are constantly changing and adapting, minute by minute and year after year. You may not truly appreciate the immense amount of work that goes on behind the scenes of your conscious mind that makes the experience of embodiment seem so natural. The constant activity of your body maps is so seamless, so automatic, so fluid and ingrained, that you don&#x2019;t even recognize it is happening, much less that it poses an absorbing scientific puzzle that is spawning fascinating insights into human nature, health, learning, our evolutionary past and our cybernetically enhanced future.<br><br>From Chapter 6: <br>&#x201c;Carter&#x201d; was a master chef at a well-known New York restaurant when, in late 1994, a blood clot in his brain almost cost him his livelihood. Rushed to the hospital in time to receive state-of-the-art clot dissolving care, Carter was left with a potentially devastating problem: He could no longer recognize fruits and vegetables. He couldn&#x2019;t tell a banana from a leek, though he could still tell a bread knife from a butcher knife and a hawk from a handsaw. He could use English fluently, and his senses were all intact. He had no discernible problems naming or thinking about any other categories of object-just fruits and veggies.<br>It sounds like a career killer for a chef, but Carter managed to get by. You see, his brain's network body maps still knew what to do with each item. There was nothing wrong with the body maps containing his visual-motor templates for how to manipulate objects. And there was nothing wrong with the body maps that storehoused his library of well-practiced motor sequences involved in food prep. He could still peel a carrot, slice a tomato, or dice an onion&#x2014;but first he had to be told what each thing was. He would simply query the kitchen staff: &#x201c;Hey, Jane, is this a cucumber? &#x201c;Yeah? Thanks.&#x201d; Chop chop chop.</p><h2>Weasel in My Meatsafe</h2><p>The author spent his childhood wandering over the spoilbanks of worked-out coal mines.

In this unabridged version, Gray gives a spirited delivery of his message, especially when role-playing typical male/female interactions. Although it takes some time to adjust to his slightly nasal tone, the information is sound and gives both men and women helpful hints on improving themselves and their union. (Running time: 9.5 hours, 6 cassettes) <i>--Sharon Griggins</i>Popular marriage counselor and seminar leader John Gray provides a unique, practical and proven way for men and women to communicate and relate better by acknowledging the differences between them. <p>Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met, fell in love, and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences. Then they came to earth and amnesia set in: they forgot they were from different planets. </p><p>Using this metaphor to illustrate the commonly occurring conflicts between men and women, Gray explains how these differences can come between the sexes and prohibit mutually fulfilling loving relationships. Based on years of successful counseling of couples, he gives advice on how to counteract these differences in communication styles, emotional needs and modes of behavior to promote a greater understanding between individual partners. Gray shows how men and women react differently in conversation and how their relationships are affected by male intimacy cycles ("get close", "back off"), and female self-esteem fluctuations ("I'm okay", "I'm not okay"). He encourages readers to accept the other gender's particular way of expressing love, and helps men and women learn how to fulfill each other's emotional needs. </p><p>With practical suggestions on how to reduce conflict, crucial information on how to interpret a partner's behavior and methods for preventing emotional "trash from the past" from invading new relationships, <em>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus </em>is a valuable tool for couples who want to develop deeper and more satisfying relationships with their partners.</p></p><h2>Journey to Monticello: Traveling in Colonial Times (Adventures in Colonial America)</h2><p>Follows a young man as he uses different modes of transportation to make the long difficult trip from Massachusetts to Virginia in the spring of 1775.</p><p></p><h2>The One Year Chronological Bible NLT, Premium Slimline Large Print</h2><p>Now available in large print editions, <i>The One Year Chronological Bible</i> is ideal for anyone who wants to take a fresh look at the Bible by reading it in the order the events actually happened.

How are we to understand his decision to forsake the land of his birth and build a new life in the still young German Democratic Republic? These are the questions at the core of this memoir by Victor Grossman, who was born Stephen Wechsler but changed his name after defecting to the GDR. <br><br>A child of the Depression, Grossman witnessed firsthand the dislocations wrought by the collapse of the U.S. economy during the 1930s. Widespread unemployment and poverty, CIO sit-down strikes, and the fight to save Republican Spain from fascism-all made an indelible impression as he grew up in an environment that nurtured a commitment to left-wing causes. He continued his involvement with communist activities as a student at Harvard in the late 1940s and after graduation, when he took jobs in two factories in Buffalo, New York, and tried to organize their workers. <br><br>Fleeing McCarthyite America and potential prosecution, Grossman worked in the GDR with other Western defectors and eventually became, as he notes, the "only person in the world to attend Harvard and Karl Marx universities." Later, he was able to establish himself as a freelance journalist, lecturer, and author. Traveling throughout East Germany, he evaluated the failures as well as the successes of the GDR's "socialist experiment." He also recorded his experiences, observations, and judgments of life in East Berlin after reunification, which failed to bring about the post-Communist paradise so many had expected. <br><br>Written with humor as well as candor, Crossing the River provides a rare look at the Cold War from the other side of the ideological divide. <br><br>Mark Solomon, a distinguished historian of the American left, provides a historical afterword that places Grossman's experiences in a larger Cold War context.</p><p>An American defector&#39;s Cold War odyssey.Victor Grossman lives in Berlin.

Philippe Descola transcribes the complex story of this people thoughtful, piquant prose reminiscent of the best in French literature.Philippe Descola is presently a professor of anthropology at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris.</p><h2>Heather Has Two Mommies</h2><p>When Heather goes to playgroup, at first she feels bad because she has two mothers and no father, but then she learns that there are lots of different kinds of families and the most important thing is that all the people love each other.</p><p>This handsome 10-anniversary edition of a minor classic presents the story of Heather, a preschooler with two moms who discovers that some of her friends have very different sorts of families. Juan, for example, has a mommy and a daddy and a big brother named Carlos. Miriam has a mommy and a baby sister. And Joshua has a mommy, a daddy, and a stepdaddy. Their teacher Molly encourages the children to draw pictures of their families, and reassures them that "each family is special" and that "the most important thing about a family is that all the people in it love each other." In the afterword, the author (whose other children's books include <i>Matzo Ball Moon</i>) explains that although she grew up in a Jewish home, in a Jewish neighborhood, there were no families like hers on the television or in picture books. She came to regard her family as somehow "wrong," since there was no Christmas tree in the living room and no Easter egg hunt. Whatever the religious right may wish to think about nontraditional families, there is no denying that any child enrolled in an American school will encounter friends with single parents, gay parents, stepparents, or adoptive parents. This new, revised version of <i>Heather Has Two Mommies</i> offers an enjoyable, upbeat, age-appropriate introduction to the idea of family diversity. The book is essential for children (ages 2 to 6) with gay parents or family members, and a great addition to a Rainbow Curriculum. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Diana Souza illustrates and designs for authors and publishers throughout the nation.

Then you realize those qualities don&#x2019;t come from just anywhere. They come from generations of women raised to cultivate an extraordinary sense of self. French women know who they are, like who they are, and excel at presenting who they are.<br><br>The rest of us are often susceptible to the next fad, the new thing, the ultimate diet. We&#x2019;re always seeking, instead of realizing that what we already are may be just right. Rarely does an American woman feel as comfortable in her own skin as her French counterpart. And rarely does an American woman have that essentially French ability to say no---to refuse anything that doesn&#x2019;t suit her, whether that thing is a job, a man, or the season&#x2019;s latest styles.<br><br>Provocative and practical, lively and intelligent, <i>Entre Nous</i> unlocks the mystery of the French girl and the secrets of her self-possession. Why do French women always look inimitably stylish? How do they manage to sit in a caf� for a three-course lunch and a glass of wine...by themselves? How do they decide when they&#x2019;re ready to let someone become a part of their very private lives?<br><br>Laced with practical tips, engaging sidebars, and essential observations about French women and their ways, <i>Entre Nous</i> is a delightful book that will help you take the best of all pages from the French girl&#x2019;s book---the page that reveals how to really enjoy life.<br><br></p><p><br><b>Debra Ollivier</b> has written for <i>Salon, Harpers, Playboy, Le Monde</i>, and a variety of other publications. She&#x2019;s a California girl who married a Frenchman and lived in France, where her children were born, for a decade. She now lives in Los Angeles.<br><br><br><b>Entre Nous</b><br><i><b>One</b></i><br><br><i><b>La T�te</b></i><br><br><i>As it happened, the first true French girl</i> I ever met was Natalie. She was living in an old renovated farmhouse at the time, just south of Paris, where her husband and a group of aspiring Truffauts were shooting a film on unrequited love and existentialism. (Only in France, no?) Natalie was wearing a close-fitting black skirt over a voluptuouslypregnant belly, a camisole under a sheer blouse, and suede ankle boots. Her long hair was pulled back with a tortoiseshell barrette, though several fugitive strands tumbled onto her shoulders in unruly wisps, and she wore not one bit of makeup.<br><br>She was perfectly content and undeniably sensual, and when she spoke, which she did sparingly, you could tell she had a superbly intelligent mind. It was just all there, that incredible mix of beauty and brains that seems to imbue French girls with such interesting faces, such refined strength. It would have been easy to suggest that Natalie's allure was a function of something physical (her hair, her clothes, her overall look). Too easy. Like so many French girls Natalie's <i>je ne sais quoi</i> was less about her look and much more about her history: She had been shaped by generations of independent feminine spirits (countless queens, courtesans, and traditional French mothers); by unspoken codes of social grace and courtly love; by a legacy of feminine guile and intellectual brawn--and at that moment, walking down a country lane in a land where the layers of civilization were so thick you could almost cut them with a knife, all I wanted to do was leave the planet and be reborn French.<br><br>That, alas, was not to be.<br><br>I did, however, have the opportunity to live long enough in France to ponder, with a certain privileged proximity, those essential qualities that make the French girl so French. And in coming to understand the core principles that shape her perception of the world, I began to wonderhow we, with our own cultural baggage and American juju, could integrate some of these qualities into our own lives and get in touch with our own inner French girls. Clearly we had to look past the fabled French style--"the look," if you will, that it is so easy to mistake for the defining feature of the French girl--and consider the expression of something much deeper, some basic truths about how she sees herself and carries herself in the world.<br><br>If you peel back the surface details, these essential qualities emanate like spokes into every aspect of the French girl's life: They influence how she carries herself, the clothes she wears, the men she brings into her life (or doesn't). They shape her self-image, what she reads, how and what she eats. They temper her experience of sensuality, her notion of time, and the tenor of her family life.<br><br>Like the smooth surface of a river stone, many of these qualities have been honed by centuries of culture and civilization. Still, many of them can be cultivated (to each woman, her own private garden), and in the following chapters we'll explore how. For now, just what exactly are these essential qualities, and how do they shape the French girl's perception of herself and the world at large?<br>She Is Self-Possessed<br><br>If you strip away the stereotypes and contradictions about her, one of the fundamental qualities associated with the French girl is her sense of self-possession. She is entirely, unequivocally self-contained. She is focused on living herown full life, following her own agenda and cultivating her actual self, rather than reinventing herself or pining away to be someone she's not. Throughout her life, she invests herself in learning and experiencing, not to <i>change</i> who she is, but to <i>become</i> more fundamentally and more fully who she truly is. Taking her cues predominantly from within--from the life of her mind and the exercise of her critical intelligence--she is imbued with a strength of character and a certain sensitivity. Because she is sure of who she is on the inside, she naturally, inevitably, appears sure of herself on the outside.<br><i>French Girls We Love</i><br><br>JEANNE D'ARC<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For listening to the voices and following her heart. <i>La Pucelle</i> (the maid) was honest and passionate and fearless--she really was the first guerrilla girl. We consider her short life of amazing accomplishment and we want to be better, believe harder, stand taller. See the 1928 classic silent film by Carl Dryer, <i>The Passion of Joan of Arc,</i> or the 1999 talkie, <i>The Messenger</i>: <i>The Story of Joan of Arc</i> by Luc Bresson. Read scholar Regine Pernoud's <i>Joan of Arc: Her Story</i> or Vita Sackville-West's somewhat flawed but beautifully written <i>Saint Joan of Arc</i>. Or better yet, read <i>Joan of Arc</i>, Mark Twain's (yes, that Mark Twain) meticulous and lovingly executed biographical novel. He considered this his most important and finest work. Don't tell Tom and Huck.<br>There is also a lovely, dreamy paradox about theFrench girl, and it's this: in having a strong sense of self, she's able to let go of herself; that in being self-contained, she's able to be vulnerable--all without unraveling at the seams. It's that m�lange of sensitivity and <i>sang froid</i> that so delicately lingers around her, like a subtle aura.<br><br>Every choice she makes underscores this basic relationship to herself: The French girl tends to her personal, private garden with dedication. By taking care of herself in ways both large and small, she is free to take care of others, free to focus on real living rather than rushing through the essentials. She understands that being of service to others is contingent on being of service to oneself. There is nothing accidental here, nothing random in her composure: It is the result of an awareness of--and commitment to--herself.<br>She Seeks Sensuality<br><br>There is also something more corporeal at play here--an inspired sensuality, an exalted simplicity that intoxicates us Anglo-Saxons when we visit France--and that is the premium the French girl puts on experiencing pleasure: Pleasure in ordinary moments. Pleasure in extraordinary moments. She does not confuse commerce with culture and the narrative in her life does not come from what she buys or sees on TV; rather, it comes from getting sensual satisfaction in the moment, from feeling an almost tactile pleasure and evocative power in the seemingly mundane. Remember Audrey Tautou in <i>Am�lie?</i> She dips her handsinto sacks of grain just for the pleasure of how it feels. She relishes the crackle of a teaspoon breaking the crust of a cr�me br�l�e. And she soothes herself skipping stones at Canal St. Martin.<br><br>Sensuality is so pervasive in her life that it is almost transparent. It is in the general texture of life, the patina of age that comes with time. It is in the baking of bread by hand, the aging of wine. It is in the color of inkwells or damask drapes, in the uproarious flamboyance of architecture. And it is fundamentally in the perfection of imperfections--the complexity and realness that create character, depth, and charm.<br>"One is not born a woman; rather one becomes a woman."<br><br>SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR<br>Being anchored in these priorities gives the French girl the sophisticated and sexy self-confidence that has put her in the Feminine Hall of Fame and made her an icon world-wide. She so fully and unequivocally inhabits her own space, and with such individualistic flair, that it seems as if even from the earliest age she has always been sure of who she is and where she's going. And perhaps she has. As Edith Wharton saw her, " ... she is, in nearly all respects,as different as possible from the average American woman. The French woman is <i>grown-up."</i><br><i>Le Film</i><br><br>LA DOUBLE VIE DE VERONIQUE (The Double Life of Veronique)<br><br>&nbsp;<br>See this for the luminous, rapturous performance of star Irene Jacobs as Veronique, who reminds us that if we're not living with a truly sensual appreciation of everything around us, we're not really living at all.<br>She Practices Discretion<br><br>From her sense of self-possession flows another essential quality that shapes her world definitively: discretion. The French girl wears her discretion like a filter or a screen, and every decision in her life passes through it: what she wears, how she spends her time, who she lets into her life, what she says (and does not say). Discretion is an ongoing act of self-editing.<br><br>The French girl understands that even the smallest gesture is a choice, a purposeful selection of one path over another, one outcome over another, one impression over another. There is nothing random or haphazard about her. Everything is about personal choice and behind every decision is a deliberate, thoughtful reflex: <i>Is this really me? Should I speak my mind or hold back? How should I</i><i>approach this particular person? How much of myself do I reveal? What is the true value of this friendship, this experience, this thing? Does this make me feel good, sexy, alive?</i><br><i>Borrow a Page from the French Girl's</i> <i>Book: Self-Possession</i><br><br>Find your center and live there. Resist the pressure to be someone you're not; instead, focus on fully developing who you are. Don't get thrown off course by the prevailing winds of trend. Engage in real, in-the-moment pleasure, not mindless entertainment. Feed your mind. Cultivate impressions and opinions. Know what you think.<br>The French girl's discretion is often most apparent in what she chooses <i>not</i> to say. Like her culture she's private and nonconfessional. (We, on the other hand, are public and confessional. Sit two Americans on a park bench and you'll get at least one life story in five minutes flat.) By not revealing herself easily--her secrets, her inclin...<br></p><h2>The Hawk and the Dove: Paul Nitze, George Kennan, and the History of the Cold War</h2><p><p>Only two Americans held positions of great influence throughout the Cold War. The two men embodied opposing strategies for winning the conflict. Yet they dined together, attended the weddings of each other's children, and remained lifelong friends.</p><p>Paul Nitze was a consummate insider who believed the best way to avoid a nuclear clash was to prepare to win one. George Kennan was a diplomat turned academic whose famous "X article" persuasively argued that we should contain the Soviet Union while waiting for it to collapse from within. A masterly double biography,<i> The Hawk and the Dove</i> "does an inspired job of telling the story of the Cold War through the careers of two of its most interesting and important figures" (<i>The Washington Monthly</i>).</p></p><p><p>Nicholas Thompson is an editor at Wired magazine, a fellow at the New America Foundation, and a regular contributor to CNN. He has written articles for The New York Times, The Washington Post and numerous other publications. A grandson of Paul Nitze's, he lives in New York City with his wife and son.</p>Working in the intricate web of American diplomacy during the Cold War, Paul Nitze and George Kennan became legendary. This double biography keeps them entwined like thorny roses of two colors on a trellis. Their accomplishments in designing and managing U.S./Soviet policy generate a riveting account that is logically organized, eloquently written, and well documented. Michael Prichard, one of the best nonfiction audio narrators, lifts the prose from the page to reality with his ability to enrich it with nuance and fluidity. He creates identifiable character voices for the principals without sounding comedic. Prichard&#39;s method of allowing the humor and satire to speak for themselves encourages listeners to smile at whatever they wish.

The companion novels center around a new personification of evil that goes by the name of Tak, unearthed by an evil mining company that's destroying the earth in the name of profit. In each, the characters and situations are altered as King plays with questions of identity and form. But the real point here is what's on Tak's mind? Does it want to "Eat pork rinds? . . .

So too have Magnus&#x2019;s few skeletal remains, now handed over to the only man who can fit together the pieces of this mystery...<br><br>What forensic detective Gideon Oliver discovers could shake the Torkelsson family tree to its very roots. But this time his work is yielding more questions about the past than answers. Questions about the long-ago execution-style murder of Magnus&#x2019;s brother...about a mysterious will that benefits&#x2014;as well as incriminates&#x2014;its heirs...and most disturbing of all: questions as to the true identity of the corpse in the lagoon. As lie upon lie is revealed, Gideon&#x2019;s only hope is to let the bones of the dead condemn the living&#x2014;before the living take revenge.</p><p><b>Aaron Elkins</b> is the author of the Edgar� Award-winning Gideon Oliver mysteries. He also co-authors the&nbsp;Alix London mysteries and the&nbsp;Lee Ofsted golf mysteries with his wife, Charlotte.In Edgar-winner Elkins's solid 12th whodunit to feature forensic anthropologist Gideon Oliver (after 2004's acclaimed <i>Good Blood</i>), Oliver's Hawaiian vacation turns into a busman's holiday, as he and close friend John Lau, an FBI agent who's also enjoying some downtime, get involved in a decade-old mystery surrounding the deaths of two elderly Swedish brothers who owned a huge cattle ranch. One night in 1994, hit men acting for an unknown client murdered Torkel Torkelsson, then attempted to conceal the corpse with an act of arson; that same night, Magnus Torklesson and a pilot took off in a small plane, never to be heard from again. Now divers have discovered the wreckage of the long-lost plane in a lagoon, with some skeletal remains. Soon learning that none of the original police investigation's conclusions may be valid, Oliver and Lau find themselves intrigued and frustrated by the lies and evasions pitched rapidly at them by the Torkelssons' heirs, all of whom have different motives for obscuring the truth. Oliver's deductions will remind classic mystery readers of archetypal scientific sleuth Dr. Thorndyke, and his three-dimensional personality and humor will continue to attract first-timers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nevertheless, in 1917 he performed a single illusion that has been hotly debated ever since: Under the bright spotlights of New York&#x2019;s Theatre Hippodrome, he made a live elephant disappear. Where did he learn this amazing trick and how did it work? The answers lie in magic expert Jim Steinmeyer&#x2019;s chronicle of illusionary innovation, backstage chicanery and espionage, elevated showmanship, and keen competition within the world of magicians. Steinmeyer has captured the cultural history of magic during its &#x201c;Golden Age&#x201d; in America and abroad. Readers will learn the secrets and life stories of the fascinating personalities behind optical marvels such as floating ghosts appearing onstage and interacting with live actors, disembodied heads, and vanishing ladies. The people and events surrounding each step toward &#x201c;The Vanishing Elephant&#x201d; reveal how simple principles, mixed with ingenious psychology, can entertain and deceive. Houdini&#x2019;s great feat of invisibility was based on a secret passed onto him by Charles Morritt, and the trick remained their secret for more than eighty years. In this book, Steinmeyer reveals Houdini&#x2019;s mystery and more.</p><p>JIM STEINMEYER has designed illusions for all of today&#x2019;s leading magicians including Ricky Jay, for his Broadway show On the Stem, David Copperfield, and Siegfried and Roy, Las Vegas revues, and television specials, and the late Doug Henning. He is the writer and producer of A&amp;E&#x2019;s four-hour history of magic, The Story of Magic, and author of many books and articles on the history of magic and theatrical effects. He lives in Los Angeles.The success of a magician "lies in making a human connection to the magic." Create an illusion in the audience's mind, and they're hooked. But to understand magicians, we need to understand the art of that creation. Steinmeyer, who has designed illusions for Siegfried and Roy and David Copperfield, presents a cultural history of magic's golden age (from the 1890s to the 1930s), some legendary tricks (including the Levitation of Princess Karnak and Harry Houdini's Disappearing Elephant) and the fierce rivalries that dominated the craft. Steinmeyer reveals certain secrets, which rely on engineering, artistry and sheer chutzpah, but he hasn't betrayed anyone; most of his information has been published elsewhere. What he adds is context. Magicians advertise deceit, then perform it. Unlike political chicanery, which Steinmeyer dubs dishonest trickery, magic is a kind of pure trickery. Audiences pay for a ruse, not a lecture on fraud. Do we believe movie special effects are real? Of course not, but it doesn't detract from our enjoyment. Similarly, while many 19th-century spiritualists were rightfully debunked as frauds and charlatans, audiences loved the antics. Some, such as the Davenport brothers, were a magnet of controversy and a wild hit, successfully mixing "religion, agnosticism, science, superstition, and fraud." Steinmeyer diagrams famous tricks, celebrating their science and ingenuity. Readers meet characters as colorful as their acts. Buyer beware: If you want to keep your illusions, go to Las Vegas. But for magic lovers who revel in learning the magician's art, this book part research study, part salute is a find. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos and diagrams.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bad Penny (A Cat Dupree Novel, 3)</h2><p><strong>Revisit book 3 of the Kat Dupree novels&#x2014;a fan-favorite romantic suspense series from </strong><strong><em>New York Times</em></strong><strong> best-selling author Sharon Sala</strong><br><br>Cat Dupree would love nothing more than to settle down and build a life with fellow bounty hunter Wilson McKay.

He swung a weak fist at the varmint, which merely scuttled behind a pile of empty boxes in the alley where he had just spent the night.<br><br>The taste in Jimmy's mouth was a perfect accompaniment to the stench in the alley. Gagging between breaths, he staggered to his feet. It took a few moments for him to gain his footing; when he did, he took the first good look at his surroundings. It wasn't the Hilton. He wasn't sure how he'd gotten here or even exactly where "here" was, but he was definitely in a garbage-filled alley between two abandoned buildings.<br><br>Groaning softly from the aches in his bones and the roiling in his belly, he swiped a shaky hand across his face and stumbled toward the street, anxious to find a bathroom. As he did, a gust of wind rushed through the redbrick canyon, whipping dirt into his eyes. He turned away from the blast just as a couple of sheets of old newspaper wrapped around his ankles. Thinking the paper would be useful to use for toilet paper, he grabbed the pages and headed for the open doorway of the building on his right. He was halfway over the threshold when his gaze fell on a headline in the middle of the page. He stopped.<br><br><i>Local Bondsman Survives Murder Attempt</i><br><br>As he read, he began to curse. His attempt at revenge for himself and his brother, Houston Franks, had gone south. This was pathetic. He couldn't even shoot a man and make it stick. His need for a bathroom forgotten, he wadded up the paper and headed for the street.<br><br>He couldn't believe it! He'd made a vow to make Wilson McKay pay for having him arrested for assault, so he couldn't bail Houston out of jail. He had pumped numerous bullets into McKay as payback and had been so certain the deed was done. But McKay was alive and, according to the reporter who'd written the piece, healing nicely.<br><br>"Damn it! Damn it all to hell!" Jimmy yelled, as he stomped out of the alley and down the street.<br><br>He was so angry he could hardly think. He needed to talk to Houston, but Houston had already hightailed it out of Texas. It was a disgrace. Jimmy still couldn't believe his own brother had left him stranded like this. He didn't have any money. He didn't have a place to stay. And even worse, he needed to find a dealer.<br><br>Sick to his stomach and shaking with every step, Jimmy began looking for familiar territory and faces. He was, by damn, going to finish what he'd started with McKay.<br><br>But first he needed to find himself a fix.<br><br>Luis Montoya was a short, stocky Latino with the blood of his Aztec ancestors strong on his face. His eyes were dark, and his mouth was wide and full. He had a stubborn cut to his jaw and a head of thick, black hair that he wore in a short ponytail at the nape of his neck. He'd been a part of the Mexican police department in Chihuahua for eleven years, the last five as a detective in Homicide. He was a proud man who didn't play favorites, and he was not influenced by people with money.<br><br>This morning, he'd had a fight with his wife, Conchita, a flat tire on his car and had burned his tongue on his first sip of coffee. All that, and it wasn't even eight o'clock. Then he'd gotten to work only to be handed a case no one wanted&#x2014;one with no new leads.<br><br>All he knew was that the victim's name was Solomon Tutuola. His body had been found in the debris of a home fire. According to the records, Tutuola had purchased the mansion only days before his death. But Tutuola hadn't died in the fire. According to the coroner, it was the multitude of bullet wounds in his body that had done him in. The fire had only added insult to injury.<br><br>Someone had committed murder. It was now his job to find out who.<br><br>Montoya picked up the file, patted his pocket to make sure his cell phone was there and headed for the door. He had an appointment to meet with Chouie Garza, the Realtor who'd sold Tutuola the mansion. The man had already given a statement the night of the fire, but Montoya liked to question his own witnesses.<br><br>He glanced at his wristwatch as he slid behind the wheel. A few moments later, he was pulling out of the parking lot and into traffic. The hunt for a killer had begun.<br><br>Thirty minutes later, he'd found the location, pulled off the highway and started up the drive leading to what had once been a grand home. Now there was nothing left but ruins. A small white Honda was parked near a saguaro. There was a man leaning against the hood. Chouie Garza, he hoped.<br><br>Montoya pulled up beside the Honda, then got out with his cop face on.<br><br>"Chouie Garza?"<br><br>The little man came forward, nodding nervously. <i>"S�. S�, </i>se�or."<br><br>"Detective Montoya. I want to ask you a few questions about Solomon Tutuola, the man who died here. You sold him the house, did you not?"<br><br>Garza nodded again. "About three days before the fire."<br><br>Montoya began to make notes. "Was anyone else with him when you met with him?"<br><br>"No. He was alone."<br><br>"What was your impression of him?" Montoya asked.<br><br>Garza's eyes widened. <i>"El Diablo."</i><br><br>Now it was Montoya's turn to be surprised. "How so?"<br><br>Garza made the sign of the cross, then glanced over his shoulder, as if merely speaking of the man might resurrect his ghost.<br><br>"There were strange tattoos all over his body...even his face, which had recently been burned, I think. The skin was still pink and healing, and he had no hair on that side of his head."<br><br>Montoya frowned. "Can you describe the tattoos?"<br><br>"Geometric designs, you know, like something on an old pottery. His teeth were filed into points, and when he smiled, it was like looking at a lion."<br><br>Montoya remembered the picture that had come into their office. It was true: the man had a devilish appearance, and Garza's description verified the identity again.<br><br>Montoya glanced up, eyeing the burned-out rubble.<br><br>"To your knowledge, was he living here alone?"<br><br>Garza shrugged. "I think he had hired a cook and a yard man, but I never saw them. I only saw him... and his money." He shifted nervously from one foot to the other before smoothing his hands over his thickly pomaded hair, then wiping them on the legs of his pants.<br><br>Montoya arched an eyebrow as he watched Garza fidgeting. He didn't think the man was lying, but his actions did explain the slightly shiny appearance of the legs of his suit pants. It wasn't from pressing marks; it was grease. His interest shifted as he resumed his interrogation.<br><br>"You say Tutuola had money. What kind of money are we talking about?"<br><br>Garza began motioning with his hands. "When he decided he would buy this house, he wanted to take possession immediately. I told him that was impossible, that papers had to go through a process. So he offered to pay the owners whatever they wanted to let him take immediate possession. When they agreed, he opened up the trunk of his car. There was the bag, like a suitcase, and it was full of money. I never saw so much money in my life."<br><br>"He paid you cash?"<br><br>Garza nodded. "By the handful."<br><br>Montoya smiled. Motive. Now things were beginning to make sense.<br><br><i>McKay Ranch&#x2014;outside of Austin, Texas</i><br><br>Morning came softly, without warning or fanfare. It broke on the eastern horizon with little more than a hint of the warmth to come&#x2014;a flourish of light bathing the sky in hues of pink and yellow. A jet trail running from north to south took on the appearance of a hot-pink comet as the sun continued its arc.<br><br>Cat Dupree watched the display from the back porch while her coffee went cold in the cup. She'd been here before&#x2014;to the ranch where Wilson had grown up. Only that time, she'd been the one who'd been recovering. This time it was Wilson, who, unlike Humpty Dumpty, <i>had </i>been put back together again&#x2014; by the skill of the surgeons at Dallas Memorial Hospital.<br><br>If she thought about it, she could still feel her panic as she'd stood at Wilson's bedside and watched him flatline. She'd screamed. First in shock, next in rage, then, finally, in denial. She'd refused to let him die.<br><br>So he hadn't.<br><br>And now they were together again, figuring out where to go from here.<br><br>The family cat came trotting up the back steps, then leaped into the porch swing beside Cat and head-butted her elbow. She set down her cold coffee, freeing up her lap.<br><br>"Well, what are you waiting for?" Cat asked.<br><br>The old tomcat chirped once, hopped up into her lap, sniffed the two buttons on the front of her blue chambray shirt, then curled up on her legs and began cleaning his paws.<br><br>Cat was scratching at a spot between his ears when she heard the back door open.<br><br>She glanced over her shoulder. The man coming out was pale and a good ten pounds thinner than he had been the month before. But the thick, spiky hair, the single gold earring and the gleam in his eye were still the same.<br><br>"Wilson. I didn't know you were up," she said.<br><br>"I couldn't find you," he said.<br><br>Cat shook her head, then patted the empty spot beside her.<br><br>"You should have known I wouldn't be far."<br><br>Wilson eyed the cat in her lap. "Is there room?"<br><br>She grinned. "Stop pouting and come sit."<br><br>Wilson eased himself into the seat beside her, then gave the cat an additional scratch before sliding his arm around her shoulders.<br><br>"Why are you up so early?" he asked. "Couldn't you sleep?"<br><br>"Didn't want to miss the show," she said, pointing to the sky, which was slowly turning to day.<br><br>Wilson looked up, then sighed softly. "Oh, yeah. I see what you mean."<br><br>Cat put a hand on his leg, grateful for the pulse of lifeblood as it flowed through his veins.<br><br>"Living in a city makes you forget things like sunrises."<br><br>"Living in a city makes you forget all kinds of things," he added. "Like how to enjoy life without buying into the rat race."<br><br>Cat leaned against him, making sure not to put weight on any of his still-healing wounds.<br><br>"A person could get used to this."<br><br>"Definitely," Wilson added, then, like Cat, let himself in on the light show breaking in the east.<br><br>As Wilson sat, he looked down at the woman in his arms. The defiance that had been with her for so long was gone. Losing the fury that came with the need for revenge had made room for his love. It seemed like a lifetime ago that he'd first seen her, carrying an unconscious man over her shoulder and out of a burning building. He hadn't known then that she was a bounty hunter, but he knew it now. The woman was fierce beyond belief. She'd tracked down the killer of her best friend with relentless determination, then dragged him kicking and screaming back to Dallas to stand trial.<br><br>And no one but Wilson knew the depths to which she'd gone to exact retribution from the man who'd killed her father, then cut her throat and left her for dead. After endless years of looking, she had finally found him, trailed him through the Mexican desert to Chihuahua, and ended what she'd begun to fear was a hopeless quest.<br><br>When Tutuola died, Cat's rage had died with him. And their relationship, which Wilson had sometimes feared was one-sided, had begun to flourish. Then he'd been shot. And according to Cat, his heart had stopped when he'd come out of surgery. He didn't remember much about that, but he did remember hearing Cat screaming at him, begging him not to die on her, too. She was a formidable woman to oppose.<br><br></p><h2>The Pond</h2><p>A touching picture book for children about a young boy and his family overcoming the loss of his father.

The author tells a lurid tale of greed, manipulation, power and prejudice that has made LA one of the most cosmopolitan and class-divided cities in the United States.</p><p>Mike Davis peers into a looking glass to divine the future of Los Angeles, and what he sees is not encouraging: a city--or better, a concatenation of competing city states--torn by racial enmity, economic disparity, and social anomie. Looking backward, Davis suggests that Los Angeles has always been contested ground. In the 1840s, he writes, a combination of drought and industrial stock raising led to the destruction of small-scale Spanish farming in the region. In the 1910s, Los Angeles was the scene of a bitter conflict between management and industrial workers, so bitter that the publisher of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> retreated to a heavily fortified home he called "The Bivouac." And in 1992, much of the city fell before flames and riot in a scenario Davis describes as thus: "Gangs are multiplying at a terrifying rate, cops are becoming more arrogant and trigger-happy, and a whole generation is being shunted toward some impossible Armageddon." Davis's voice-in-a-whirlwind approach to the past, present, and future of Los Angeles is alarming and arresting, and his book is essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary affairs. <i>--Gregory MacNamee</i>&#34;An eye-opening account of the economic, political, intellectual and architectural development of 20th-century Los Angeles, City of Quartz is a deeply troubling look at a city beset by environmental time bombs, vast inequities of wealth and chronic, increasingly brutal racial violence...The city that takes shape in this elegantly argued book seems to be swiftly heading toward some Armageddon...Few books shed as much light on their subjects as this opionated and original excavation of Los Angeles from the mythical debris of its past and future.&#34;--Sara Frankel, The San Francisco Examiner</p><h2>Eichmann and the Holocaust</h2><p>Inspired by the trial of a bureaucrat who helped cause the Holocaust this radical work on the banality of evil stunned the world with its exploration of a regimes moral blindness and one mans insistence that he be absolved all guilt because he was only following orders</p><p>Hannah Arendt was born in Germany in 1906.

The raw beauty of its landscape is breathtaking. A proximity to animals and the environment has led to a rich heritage of songs and tales related to nature. This book includes 25 traditional Mongolian folktales. The most ancient date back to the 12th century and are concerned with human relations with the natural world. Others use the whimsicality of animals to describe people�s struggles to find a good and decent life. Still others frankly applaud cunning, with, and the ability to survive an unfriendly competition. The immediacy of these stories and illustrations is compelling. The tales should by all rights be read aloud to children. At the same time, the foundations of the rich culture that they describe will be of significance to anyone studying Central Asian history and culture. The stories are vividly illustrated by the papercuts of the Mongolian artists N. Baatarstog. An introduction to the book has been written by the eminent authority on folktales in Mongolia, P.

A macabre human drama is re-enacted in a Gothic dolls&#39; house one night; a whistle awakens a force of unspeakable malevolence; an ancient curse is passed from person to person; a grisly crime is avenged from beyond the grave; the tomb of a Swedish count will not rest quietly. M R James&#39; chilling ghost stories reveal a world where the familiar becomes diabolical, the smallest object can lead to unimaginable horror, and evil brushes against everyday life in the most unexpected and sinister of ways.</p><p><b>Montague Rhodes James </b>was born at Goodnestone Parsonage in Kent in 1862. Although a great scholar of his day, it is now for his ghost stories, many set in East Anglia, that James is best remembered. Fascinated by the supernatural, he was an admirer of the Irish mystery-writer Sheridan Le Fanu, whose ghost stories he edited. His stories were usually first published in magazines such as the Cambridge Review, but some were written for special occasions. Wailing Well is one such story, composed for the gathering of the Eton College Boy Scouts in 1927. The stories were published in several volumes between 1904 and 1931, including&nbsp;<i>Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</i>&nbsp;(1904),&nbsp;<i>A Thin Ghost and Others</i>&nbsp;(1919) and<i>&nbsp;A Warning to the Curious</i>&nbsp;(1925). M. R. James died in 1936.</p><h2>Claudia and the Phantom Phone Calls (The Baby-Sitters Club, No.2)</h2><p>The hit series returns to charm and inspire another generation of baby-sitters! The first three classic BSC books are back, along with a brand-new prequel, The Summer Before.<br><br>Being a good baby-sitter isn't always easy, and the vice-president of the Baby-Sitters Club, Claudia Kishi, is learning that the hard way. She and the other club members have started getting strange calls on the job. Is it the Phantom Caller, a jewel thief who's been breaking into houses in the area? One thing is certain -- the Club has to take action to protect their kids!</p><p>Ann M. Martin&#39;s The Baby-Sitters Club series sold over 176 million copies and inspired a generation of young readers. Her novels include the Main Street series, BELLE TEAL, the Newbery Honor book A CORNER OF THE UNIVERSE, HERE TODAY, A DOG&#39;S LIFE, and ON CHRISTMAS EVE, as well as the much-loved collaborations P.S, LONGER LETTER LATER and SNAIL MAIL NO MORE with Paula Danziger, and THE DOLL PEOPLE and THE MEANEST DOLL IN THE WORLD, written with Laura Godwin and illustrated by Brian Selznick. She lives in upstate New York.<p>Gr 3-5 The four 12-year-old girls who comprise ``The Baby-sitters Club'' are worried about a robber whose pattern involves first calling the possible victim and then remaining silent. The girls, responsible babysitters, are at the same time gossipy girls who are variously at odds with members of their families, their schoolwork, and above all, boys. It is one of the latter who turns out to be Claudia's ``Phantom caller,'' brave enough to dial, but too shy to ask her to the dance. Martin sometimes writes as her audience would (Claudia ``goes'' rather than ``says,'' for instance). Claudia is an underachiever, but gifted in art; she has a brilliant sister she doesn't like; and she is Japanese. She should be an interesting and complex character, but she is hardly distinguishable from the other three babysitters. This contrived story is one of those ephemeral paperbacks that can easily be forgotten.

The account continues with the ultimately successful, but at times very hard fought, invasions of Sicily and southern Italy as burgeoning Allied air power, now with full US involvement, increasingly dominated the skies overhead. The successive occupations of Sardinia and Corsica are also covered in detail. This volume, then, is essentially the story of the tactical air forces up to the point when Rome was occupied, just at the same time as the Normandy landings were occurring in north-west France. In its pages are found what can justifiably be considered the story of &#x2018;the soldiers&#x2019; air force&#x2019;. Frequently overlooked by more immediate newsworthy events elsewhere, their struggle was often of an equally Homeric nature. With regards to the long-range tactical role of the Allied heavy bombers, only the period from May to October is examined herein, while they remained based in North Africa. Thus the period from November 1943 when the US 15th Air Force was formed to pursue the strategic air offensive against the Reich, together with the RAF&#x2019;s 205 Group of night bombers, will be covered in a future (sixth) volume. Volume Five will deal with the rest of the tactical war in Italy and Greece, over the Adriatic and Aegean, and with the entry into the South of France to join forces advancing southwards from Normandy.</p><p>Christopher Shores began by writing the occasional book about military aviation, then quickened the pace as he grew older. By now, readers and reviewers are hard-pressed to keep up with him. Meanwhile, he pursued a career as a land surveyor and director of one of Europe&#39;s largest firms of property advisers.&#x201c;Anyone with an interest in the campaigns in the Mediterranean theater, especially air operations, will want to acquire this volume ... highly recommended, one of the best books of the year, and we're already impatient to see volume five."

He lives in Chicago, Illinois.<br><br><b>Wendell Minor</b> is the award-winning illustrator of dozens of picture books, including his own <i>Yankee Doodle America</i>, Robert Burleigh's <i>Into the Woods</i>, and <i>Reaching for the Moon</i>, written by Buzz Aldrin.

He lives with his wife, Florence, in Washington, Connecticut. Visit Wendell Minor at www.minorart.com.Having previously written about Thoreau, Lindbergh and Babe Ruth, Burleigh continues his series of biographies of famous men in this poetic picture book about John James Audubon (1785-1851), sumptuously illustrated by Minor. The volume begins with advice to Audubon from his father: " `Be a store owner,' his father said./ But John went to the woods instead." As an author's note explains, what follows is Burleigh's imagined response, penned by Audubon in a letter to his father, in an ornate 19th-century style with rhymed couplets: "O father, dear Father, to me it seems/ No one can fail who holds to his dreams." The flow of the narrative parallels quotations from the naturalist's journals, just as Audubon's own paintings sometimes appear as spot art to mirror Minor's illustrations. Author and artist present Audubon as both idealistic and gentle, and though he doesn't "save every cent" as his father wants him to, he ends up "saving" in his artwork the disappearing world he observes ("And I must paint it all because/ We need this memory of what was"). His philosophy wafts through the volume like a summer breeze. Minor breathtakingly captures a landscape with a blue heron in the marsh as easily as a close-up of a dying dove, alongside a poem deft and sure.

Denied an experimental new treatment that could save her life by her parent's managed-care provider, the stepsister has become a symbol of a health care system more concerned with costs than with the lives of its patients. And when a wealthy executive of the family's HMO is found dead, Alan and Denver detective Sam Purdy uncover the truth that links the teenage girl to his death, and the truth behind a family willing to kill in the name of love...and revenge.</p><p>Stephen White is a clinical psychologist and <b>New York Times</b> bestselling author of thirteen previous novels, including <b>The Best Revenge</b> and <b>Missing Persons</b>.Boulder psychologist Alan Gregory confronts a hapless family's mismanaged-care nightmare, in White's overstuffed sixth thriller. The toddler of Alan's newly transplanted colleague, John Trent, has been stricken with a rare strain of viral myocarditis for which MedExcel, the family's HMO, refuses the only available treatment as too experimental; meanwhile, his wife, TV news personality Brenda Strait, is being harassed by threats and vandalism. As their daughter Chaney lies dying for lack of funds, Trent wonders how much worse things could get. Here's how much: Brenda's daughter Merritt, 15, tries to kill herself, gets dragged back to life refusing to speak, and turns out to be hiding a handgun and a bloody outfit that tie her to the murder of Dr. Edward Robilio, the founder and chairman of MedExcel. Assigned to Merritt's case, Alan finds crippling new connections among the characters at every turn. His cop friend Sam Purdy is the brother-in-law Brenda's been feuding with for years. Dr. Terence Gusman, who chairs the medical exam review board at MedExcel, is the brother of a woman fatally traumatized by Brenda's hard-nosed reporting. Even Alan's urologist neighbor Adrienne, who's been sleeping with the Trent/Strait's lawyer, thinks she prefers the lawyer's wife. As he rolls like a fifth wheel from one crime scene to the next and struggles to get his mute patient to open up--even after she starts to talk, her shocking, predictable revelations are delayed by a series of shameless ploys--Alan goggles at the unholy network of lovers, codependents, and betrayers. The result is that White (Remote Control, 1997, etc.) loses his initial focus on the indictment of uncaring HMOs; by the time you stumble to the center of this labyrinth, you're amazed that the medical community can lift a finger to help this dysfunctional community. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

I made you pancakes.&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x2014;My grandmother Inez Monk Henderson</p><p></p><p></p><p>So It Begins&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>I&#x2019;m Swedish, which makes me sexy, and I&#x2019;m Irish, which makes me want to talk about it.&#x201d;</p><p>My older sister, Sandy, coined this phrase more than twenty years ago. I use it as if it were mine, just like the forest green sweater that I &#x201c;borrowed&#x201d; from her in college, which I wore until it was threadbare and ended up in a box for charity. Isn&#x2019;t heritage community property?</p><p>But I didn&#x2019;t stop to think about what it meant until I casually trilled that line for a laugh in a talk during my first book tour. As people descended on the last of the warm white wine and softening inexpensive cheese at a cozy bookstore, an affable blond woman loitered patiently at the end of the line. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Swedish and Irish, too,&#x201d; she said when she appeared at the table where I was signing books. She described a plucky, restless lot who emigrated to America to take on hard lives in their new homeland. &#x201c;But, then, <i>my</i> parents, that&#x2019;s when it got boring,&#x201d; she said with an eye roll. &#x201c;But yours, they sound so, well, <i>interesting</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Rarely am I struck without a comment. I&#x2019;m Irish, after all. But my parents&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>interesting</i>?</p><p>&#x201c;I mean, you threw a dart at a map and moved to a strange city when you were a teenager and then you followed your dream and went to Paris,&#x201d; the woman continued in my absence of words. &#x201c;People with normal parents don&#x2019;t do things like that.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;m a typical American mutt. I didn&#x2019;t know much about my heritage then, not really. The further that I got into it, I discovered that in many ways, my family&#x2019;s story is both unremarkable and utterly fascinating. Poking into the murky edges of my ancestry, I also uncovered that I&#x2019;m not who I thought I was, that my pithy line wasn&#x2019;t quite accurate. I&#x2019;m a direct descendant of scrubwomen, a circus worker, a midwife, a bootlegger, a bigamist, an auto worker, and a cop. The most notable thing? That so many of my ancestors cooked, either for a living or as their passion. Until I started this journey, I didn&#x2019;t know just how honestly I&#x2019;d come to my love of the kitchen.</p><p>I consider what follows a multigenerational memoir. I set out to tell my parents&#x2019; tale and then realized that by extension, the whole thing necessitated sharing the lives of their parents, too.</p><p>In early research, I stumbled on a 1951 <i>Time</i> magazine article about my parents&#x2019; age group, the one typically referred to as the silent generation, the children born in the grips of the Great Depression. The so-called greatest generation, which preceded them, inspired tons of ink, as did World War II, the conflict that defined their era. The baby boomers had Vietnam and the resistance and all those cultural counterpoints. By contrast, my parents&#x2019; generation fought in Korea, sometimes called the forgotten war. <i>Time</i> magazine referred to the silent generation as a collective &#x201c;quiet, still flame.&#x201d;</p><p>My parents were rarely still, and never quiet.</p><p>I spent a lot of time separating what truly happened from family lore and legend, not always an easy task. It&#x2019;s tricky working off memory, especially when writing from many people&#x2019;s versions of long-ago events. The genesis of this book is a series of stories that my mother put down on paper years ago about my father&#x2019;s childhood, her young family&#x2019;s years in San Francisco, and life on their Michigan farm. I interviewed my mom, recording dozens of hours of conversation as we sat in our Florida cottage. We drank wine and sat in rocking chairs in a gazebo under swaying palm trees as she recalled details of her life going all the way back to the Great Depression. Then I went to work to confirm as much of it as I could. I&#x2019;m a trained journalist, so along with numerous interviews of relatives, I scoured letters, public documents, military records, and more than twenty years of research conducted by a professional genealogist.</p><p>This is a true story. No names have been changed. My cousins are <i>really</i> named Larry and Gary.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Part I</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, God, I can take it from here.&#x201d; &#x2014;My mother, Irene Henderson Flinn, on marrying my father, Milton</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>That&#x2019;s Amore</p><p>Clyde (left) and Milton Flinn at my parents&#x2019; restaurant, 1960</p><p>Hey, Milt!&#x201d; Uncle Clyde said, calling long distance. &#x201c;What do you know about pizza?&#x201d;</p><p>With that, my parents sold all their furniture and stuffed the rest of their belongings and three toddlers into the back of their 1954 Chevy Bel Air and headed to my Irish uncle&#x2019;s Italian restaurant in San Francisco.</p><p>Dad was Irish American. Mom was Swedish American. Neither of them knew anything about Italian cuisine. They didn&#x2019;t care. &#x201c;So what if we didn&#x2019;t know anything about the food?&#x201d; Mom says. &#x201c;We both believed that life should always be an adventure.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother, Irene Henderson Flinn, just twenty-four, was a pretty, shy brunette with a klutzy streak who favored those bat-wing glasses so popular in the 1950s. She was heavily pregnant, nearly five months along with her fourth child.</p><p>My father, Milton, was a twenty-seven-year-old recent college grad and Korean War veteran who had sold life insurance until a major recession swept the country.</p><p>Before they met, Mom worked her way through secretarial school and scored a well-paying position with the Michigan Council of Churches. A marine home from Korea, Dad held multiple jobs while juggling a full-time load at Michigan State yet found time to date a half dozen attractive coeds.</p><p>At least, until the night he picked Mom up at a roller-skating rink in Lansing.</p><p>&#x201c;Now reverse,&#x201d; the rink&#x2019;s announcer instructed a sea of circling skaters in a bored voice.</p><p>Dad turned in unison with the young crowd&#x2014;and slammed directly into my mom, knocking her to the concrete floor.</p><p>As he knelt to help her up, Mom took his hands, struck by his chiseled good looks and solid build. <i>A bit like Charlton Heston,</i> she thought.</p><p>Then they both noticed they were wearing matching outfits. He wore a butter yellow cotton shirt and gray wool trousers; she was clad in a soft yellow sweater and a similar gray skirt.</p><p>&#x201c;It looks like we came together!&#x201d; he joked, still holding her hands in his as they stood on the rink. &#x201c;What are the odds?&#x201d; Dad skated backward with fluid elegance while she clung to a side wall for support as the hit song &#x201c;Kisses Sweeter Than Wine&#x201d; by The Weavers played over the loudspeakers. They chatted without listening to the song&#x2019;s story of a farmer&#x2019;s life filled with children and hardships, but in the end, love made it all worthwhile. After another song, she implored him, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a great skater. You should really go skate without me.&#x201d;</p><p>He gently guided her into the brightly lit concession area and bought her a Coke instead. They talked until the staff started mopping up and they realized the place had closed. She was surprised when he offered to take her home, and even more caught off guard when he asked her on a proper date. Mom couldn&#x2019;t believe her luck that such a smart, handsome college guy wanted to date her. As she confided the story to a co-worker her age attending his college, the woman just shook her head and put up a hand to silence her.</p><p>&#x201c;Listen, I wouldn&#x2019;t get my hopes up,&#x201d; she said flatly to my mom as she fixed the circle pin on her shirt. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know he&#x2019;s dating the Water Carnival Queen? They&#x2019;re the big item around campus. I heard they&#x2019;re getting engaged.&#x201d;</p><p>The queen was a leggy, glamorous blonde. Her beauty was legend around Lansing.</p><p>Mom decided to check out her competition. She learned the beauty queen frequented a certain hair salon on Saturday mornings. With the deft nonchalance of a detective, she feigned waiting for a bus across the street until the blonde turned up. Mom watched her walk with the practiced poise of someone comfortable with being on display. Her dimpled smile showed off perfect, brilliant white teeth that matched her perfect, delicate gloves.</p><p>Mom felt beaten. She got on the next bus that arrived, even though she had no idea where it was going. As she took a seat, she gulped back tears. <i>How could I be so stupid?</i> she thought as the bus pulled away, leaving the blonde in the distance. <i>She&#x2019;s like a movie star. I don&#x2019;t stand a chance</i>.</p><p>After a few dates, Dad pulled into the drive-in movie theater. They&#x2019;d brought along their own popcorn. He asked Mom to hold the paper bag, and when he took it back he spilled it all over them. &#x201c;Irene, I&#x2019;ve got something to say,&#x201d; he started nervously.</p><p><i>Here it comes,</i> Mom thought. <i>He&#x2019;s going to dump me.</i></p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been trying to figure out a way to ask you to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He paused and took a deep breath. &#x201c;Will you marry me?&#x201d; he blurted.</p><p>&#x201c;But what about the Water Carnival Queen?&#x201d; Mom asked, incredulous.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you kidding me?&#x201d; he responded, dumbfounded. He took her hands gently in his. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the brightest, most beautiful woman I&#x2019;ve ever met. I knew you were the one for me the minute I picked you up off that rink.&#x201d;</p><p>Just a few months after getting knocked down, Mom was happily knocked up after getting married in a town named Hope. First on the scene was Milton Jr., whom they called &#x201c;Miltie.&#x201d; Douglas, &#x201c;Dougie,&#x201d; arrived almost to the day the following year, making them what relatives called Irish twins. My sister Sandy came along just two years later.</p><p>Sandy&#x2019;s birth coincided with the so-called Eisenhower recession, which began in 1958, a bleak reminder that the postwar boom years couldn&#x2019;t last forever. Michigan always feels economic turndowns harder than other parts of the country. After all, a new car is the last thing someone orders when times get tough. Unemployment hit 25 percent in the state, Great Depression numbers. Every night after they put the kids to bed, my parents stayed up late, figuring out bills, worrying.</p><p>On one of these nights, the phone rang.</p><p>Uncle Clyde had a successful Italian eatery in San Francisco. Would Milt be interested in coming out to California to learn the restaurant business?</p><p>Within two weeks, they were on the road. They sold everything except their clothes, the rocking chair, and a baby carriage. &#x201c;We really didn&#x2019;t think twice about it,&#x201d; Mom says. &#x201c;We just decided to go.&#x201d;</p><p>In Illinois, when they saw the first sign for the famous highway, Mom and Dad burst out singing &#x201c;(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66&#x201d; as the kids cheered. &#x201c;We felt like those people who went west in covered wagons,&#x201d; she says. Which made sense, since part of Route 66 follows a wagon trail blazed in 1857 by the U.S. Department of War as a way to access the western frontier. By 1926, the government joined other roads to patch together the nation&#x2019;s first cross-country highway.</p><p>Mom and Dad drove for seven days. Each morning, they scooped still-sleeping children off the hard beds of cheap roadside motels. They stopped to see a few sites to let the kids run around. They took in a big Paul Bunyan statue in Illinois, the world&#x2019;s largest rocking chair in Missouri, a blue whale in Oklahoma, and a ghost town in California. To save money, they mostly ate sandwiches for lunch and dinner, but they had breakfast out. In Amarillo, Texas, my Midwest parents discovered people outside the movies actually say &#x201c;y&#x2019;all&#x201d; when a waitress asked, &#x201c;Y&#x2019;all happy with your cheese grits?&#x201d; They had never had them before. They marveled at the flavor of the chorizo that came with their eggs at a diner in Arizona and were enchanted at the sight of tortillas in place of toast in New Mexico.</p><p>By the end of the week the novelty of the drive wore off. My parents were exhausted. Dad&#x2019;s left forearm was thoroughly sunburned, the result of hanging it out the window while he smoked his Kent cigarettes. Days of tuneless kids singing &#x201c;(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66&#x201d; over and over again grated on their nerves. The restless toddlers argued in the backseat over insignificant infractions (&#x201c;He looked at me!&#x201d;) as they trudged north in California along small highways. My brothers stopped fighting long enough to take in the sweeping view of San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate Bridge against the setting sun and commenced swatting each other again.</p><p>They found their way to 2335 Mission Street. Uncle Clyde was outside smoking when they pulled up. &#x201c;Hey, kid brother!&#x201d; he yelled, waving at Dad, tossing the butt to the ground.</p><p>In his younger days, Clyde was devilishly handsome with a solid jawline and piercing blue eyes topped off with a certain &#x201c;star&#x201d; quality. Women stopped in the street and stared at him as he greeted the family, slapping my dad on the back and assuring him that &#x201c;pizza is the future.&#x201d; He led them up to the simple apartment above the restaurant where they would live rent-free until they settled in.</p><p>The oldest boy in a family of eight, Clyde took on the sense of quasi-parental responsibility that older children often internalize in a large family. That&#x2019;s why he invited my dad to California. He could have hired someone locally to work in the kitchen and he could have rented the apartment for cash. But that wasn&#x2019;t Clyde. He knew things were bad in Michigan and he&#x2019;d always been willing to do anything for his youngest brot...</p></p><h2>Accumulation of Capital</h2><p>Rosa Luxembourg was a founding communist and then she rejected communism and then she was assasinated. Along the way she wrote this book about about how capitalism works and more important can work. Read with an open inquiring mind and enjoy a great great thinker.</p><p>British economist Joan Robinson was widely recognized for her work in monopolistic competition and capital theory. Born Joan Maurice in Chamberley, Surrey, she was educated at Girton College, Cambridge. In 1926 she married Austin Robinson, a Cambridge economist. In 1931 Joan Robinson received an appointment at Cambridge, and she remained there until 1971, succeeding her husband as a professor of economics in 1965. Robinson&#39;s most famous work, The Economics of Imperfect Competition (1933), was intended to bridge the gap between the two main types of market structures in economics---perfect competition and monopoly. Her solution was to propose a type of industry structure called monopolistic competition in which an industry would have a number of small producers, each behaving as if it were monopolistic even though its actions affected, and were affected by, the actions of its competitors. The concept of monopolistic competition, which was also proposed by Harvard economist Edward Chamberlin at the same time, was a major advance in the field of economics. Both Robinson and Chamberlin spent years defending and distinguishing their versions of the concept. Most treatments of the topic today involve elements of both, although purists give a slight edge to Chamberlin. Robinson was one of the early champions of the Keynesian revolution with her Introduction to the Theory of Employment (1937). She also wrote the classic, Essay on Marxian Economics, in which she pointed out many of the pre-Keynesian concepts in Marx&#39;s Das Kapital. Her works The Rate of Interest and Other Essays (1953) and The Accumulation of Capital (1956) attempted to develop a Keynesian approach to long-run equilibrium growth. At about the time that these were written, she thought she had discovered a flaw in the accepted theory of capital, which launched the acrimonious &#34;Cambridge controversies&#34; debate, so named because it involved both Cambridge University in England and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Much later in her career, Robinson rebelled against the prevailing economic theories that relied on comparative static analysis, and she presented her views in Economic Philosophy (1962), Economics---An Awkward Corner 1966), and An Introduction to Modern Economics (1973). Toward the end of her career, she became increasingly radical, expressing admiration for the economic systems of China under Mao Tse-Tung (see Vol. 2), and North Korea under Kim-Sung. Few economists followed her lead, however, and despite her early reputation, she finished her career on the fringes of mainstream economics.<strong>'Rosa Luxemburg is one of the really big figures in the history of the international socialist movement and </strong><em>The Accumulation of Capital</em><strong> is unquestionably her magnum opus.'</strong> - <em>New Statesman</em><br><br><strong>'This book, out of print for decades, is well worth reading ... one of her finest works.'</strong> - <em>Labour Research</em></p><h2>Madam President: A Novel</h2><p>With <i>Madam President</i>, current cohost of <i>The View</i> and former White House Communications Director Nicolle Wallace returns with an electrifying portrait of three powerful women on a day that will change the country forever.<br><br>Charlotte Kramer, the forty-fifth President of the United States, has done the unprecedented in allowing a network news team to document a day in her life&#x2014;and that of her most senior staff.

I input your final revisions myself,&#x201d; �Melanie replied in her usual calm manner.<br> <br>&#x201c;What time are we doing this?&#x201d; Charlotte was tapping her perfectly polished fingernails on the desk and swinging one of her legs back and forth underneath it as she reread her remarks. Melanie �recognized both behaviors as two of Charlotte&#x2019;s relatively well-�disguised nervous tics.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll go on the air at eleven-oh-two to give the anchors a couple of minutes to set things up and announce that you are addressing the nation live from the Oval Office.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What time is it now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s ten minutes before eleven, Madam President.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlotte nodded and looked down at the text once more. After about twenty seconds, she looked up again.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Mel, how much time until we go live?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About ten minutes, Madam President. Can I get you something to drink?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>For the first time since they&#x2019;d met nearly six years earlier, Melanie worried about Charlotte&#x2019;s ability to perform her official duties with her trademark steadiness. They were alone in the Oval Office, and it was Melanie&#x2019;s job to get the president through the next twenty-five minutes.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t Melanie&#x2019;s actual job, but this wasn&#x2019;t a typical day. Melanie served as the secretary of defense, a post she&#x2019;d held for the last eighteen months, ever since Charlotte had been reelected for a second term as the country&#x2019;s forty-fifth president. Melanie&#x2019;s Oval Office assignment was as unexpected as the events of the previous twelve hours.<br> <br>The sound of jets patrolling the airspace above the White House and the beams of light from the helicopters hovering nearby weren&#x2019;t helping with Charlotte&#x2019;s unusually high levels of agitation and impatience.<br> <br>&#x201c;Madam President, I need you to relax a little bit, or you&#x2019;re going to scare people more.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus Christ, Melanie!&#x201d; Charlotte exploded.<br> <br>Maybe it&#x2019;s good that she&#x2019;s blowing off a bit of steam, Melanie thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Without any of our guys having a goddamned clue or hint of warning, terrorists attacked five cities. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of people are dead. And we don&#x2019;t have any idea if there are more plots under way or where the attacks originated. People should be scared.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I crossed that section out of your speech. Thought it might be a little too much straight talk for tonight,&#x201d; Melanie deadpanned.<br> <br>Charlotte didn&#x2019;t smile. She stared down at the pages of her speech, but Melanie could tell she wasn&#x2019;t reading them. Melanie moved toward one of the sofas in the middle of the Oval Office and ran her hand back and forth across the smooth linen fabric that she&#x2019;d selected when Charlotte had tasked her with renovating the room at the beginning of her first term. The president hadn&#x2019;t given her any direction other than to stick to one color. She had a thing for monochromatic dressing that extended to her interior-decorating preferences. The fabric was so pale and delicate that the sofas needed to be recovered quarterly, but Charlotte said that they sent a strong signal to everyone to keep their feet off the furniture. She&#x2019;d thwarted several attempts to recover them in a more practical material.<br> <br>The down-filled couches were inviting, but Melanie knew that if she sat, her twenty-four-hour day would catch up with her, and she&#x2019;d never be able to muster the energy to get back up. She glanced down at her BlackBerry. Her executive assistant made fun of her for still carrying the antiquated device, but she&#x2019;d had a BlackBerry (at times, she&#x2019;d had two or three of them) since her first days at the White House almost two decades earlier. Now she also carried an iPhone that her husband, Brian, had given her the year before and that she used for personal communications with him and with their friends and family. Melanie scrolled through the e-mail messages on the iPhone and opened a message from Brian. He was in the White House briefing room, about forty feet away from the Oval Office, with the rest of the White House correspondents. His message simply said, &#x201c;Good luck with the speech. Call when you can. Love you.&#x201d; Melanie skimmed what looked like hundreds of unopened e-mails. They&#x2019;d have to wait until after Charlotte&#x2019;s address. When she looked up, she was surprised to see the president standing in front of the two televisions in her private dining room. Melanie walked toward the side of the Oval �Office that opened into the dining room and watched Charlotte closely for a couple of minutes. She was wearing a perfectly tailored black Armani jacket with matching pants. A pale blue silk blouse peeked out from under the jacket, and the initials of her twins, P and H, hung from a white-gold chain around her neck. Her thick blond hair was tucked behind her ears. She had stepped out of her black heels, and in her bare feet, she looked diminutive. Her makeup artist was highly skilled, but Melanie thought she&#x2019;d been a tad heavy-handed with the blush. Charlotte wouldn&#x2019;t tolerate another touch-up on a night like this, though. Melanie shifted her weight from one foot to the other and moved closer to the door so that Charlotte would know she was there.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the one who&#x2019;s not having a normal reaction, Melanie. No one should be as stoic as you are right now. Frankly, it&#x2019;s jarring,&#x201d; Charlotte said without looking away from the carnage on the screens.<br> <br>&#x201c;Madam President, you&#x2019;ve mistaken my jet lag for tranquillity. I woke up in Iraq this morning, and with the time change, I think that was about twenty-four hours ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That was this morning?&#x201d; Charlotte&#x2019;s eyes were still glued to the screens.<br> <br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t it seem like a thousand years ago?&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlotte muted the televisions and turned to face Melanie.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s safe to say that everything has changed since then, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Before Melanie could conjure up an appropriate response, the network producer who was directing the live coverage of Charlotte&#x2019;s speech knocked on the door of the Oval Office. Melanie had instructed him to do so when they were two minutes out so she could get Charlotte seated and check the camera shot.<br> <br>The president had insisted that they be left alone in the Oval �Office after the hair and makeup people left. It was unheard of to leave the president alone in the Oval Office for a televised address to the nation without someone who was trained in video production, but Melanie had held just about every job in the White House communications and press departments during her decade and a half of service in the executive branch of government.<br> <br>&#x201c;That was your two-minute warning, Madam President. You&#x2019;re going to do this just as we rehearsed it. As you requested, it&#x2019;s just you and me in here, so please do not fidget in your seat. I can keep you in focus, but if you move out of the camera shot, there&#x2019;s not much I can do to reframe you with my limited TV-production skills. Don&#x2019;t move your chair or stand up. And try not to do any forced smiling. You want to appear somber but not alarming.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d; Charlotte snapped. She took her seat behind the desk and held up one hand to shield her eyes from the glare. Lighting the Oval Office for an evening address was one of the trickier production feats. The production staff had set up freestanding stadium lights on either side of the president&#x2019;s desk to illuminate her properly for the TV audience. As she read through her speech one final time, Melanie thought she looked surly, but she didn&#x2019;t want to stoke her ire with any more instructions.<br> <br>Melanie checked the shot and confirmed that it looked OK with the professionals by opening the door a crack. The director gave her a thumbs-up, and Melanie shut the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all set, Madam President. You look great.&#x201d;<br> <br>Melanie took a deep breath and smiled reassuringly at her boss. They hadn&#x2019;t been alone in the Oval Office together in months, and until today, Melanie hadn&#x2019;t worked with her on a speech since she&#x2019;d left her post as White House chief of staff at the end of Charlotte&#x2019;s first term as president. Despite the current tragic, catastrophic circumstances, it wasn&#x2019;t uncomfortable to be with each other like this. Melanie and Charlotte had worked together long enough to take exactly what they needed from one another. Melanie was acting cooler than she felt because she sensed in Charlotte a hotness that would not translate well on camera. For her part, Charlotte was using these few precious moments to process what had happened before packing away her horror and fear and projecting strength and resolve to the entire world.<br> <br>Melanie suspected that Charlotte had chosen her for this assignment because she was the one person with whom there was no pretending. The extraordinary step had been taken to transport Melanie from Andrews Air Force Base, where she&#x2019;d landed an hour earlier, to the South Lawn of the White House in one of the helicopters typically designated as Marine One and used to transport Charlotte. Melanie assumed that it also had something to do with the fact that she&#x2019;d been through something like this before. After all, she&#x2019;d worked in the press office on September 11, 2001.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure about the Longfellow poem?&#x201d; Charlotte asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Most presidents quote from scripture on occasions like this. You said that you didn&#x2019;t want that, so I included the Longfellow quote. We are sixty seconds out, and I can&#x2019;t replace it at this point, but if you want to drop it, the speech works fine without it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. I like it. It&#x2019;s powerful. And you don&#x2019;t think we use the word toward too much? It&#x2019;s in here at least three times.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d chosen every word in the address with care.<br> <br>&#x201c;The speech is good, Madam President.&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlotte nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got this,&#x201d; she promised.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you do.&#x201d; Melanie smiled and said a silent prayer.<br> <br>At that moment, the light on the camera started flashing. When the flashing stopped, Charlotte would be seen instantly by millions of people.<br> <br>Melanie checked the teleprompter one last time to make sure the speech had loaded properly and then counted down with her fingers.<br> <br>When the light stopped flashing, Melanie mouthed, &#x201c;Go.&#x201d;</p><h2>Oscar and Lucinda</h2><p>The Booker Prize-winning novel--now a major motion picture from Fox Searchlight&nbsp;&nbsp;Pictures.<br><br>This sweeping, irrepressibly inventive novel, is a romance, but a romance of the sort that could only take place in&nbsp;&nbsp;nineteenth-century Australia. For only on that sprawling continent--a haven for misfits of both the animal and human kingdoms--could a nervous Anglican minister who gambles on the instructions of the Divine become allied with a teenaged heiress who buys a glassworks to help liberate her sex. And only the prodigious imagination of Peter Carey could implicate Oscar and Lucinda in a narrative of love and commerce, religion and colonialism, that culminates in a half-mad expedition to transport a glass church across the Outback.</p><p>Oscar Hopkins is a high-strung preacher&#39;s kid with hydrophobia and noisy knees. Lucinda Leplastrier is a frizzy-haired heiress who impulsively buys a glass factory with the inheritance forced on her by a well-intentioned adviser. In the early parts of this lushly written book, author Peter Carey renders the seminal turning points in his protagonists&#39; childhoods as exquisite 19th-century set pieces. Young Oscar, denied the heavenly fruit of a Christmas pudding by his cruelly stern father, forever renounces his father&#39;s religion in favor of the Anglican Church. &#34;Dear God,&#34; Oscar prays, &#34;if it be Thy will that Thy people eat pudding, smite him!&#34; Lucinda&#39;s childhood trauma involves a beautiful doll bought by her struggling mother with savings from the jam jar; in a misguided attempt to tame the doll&#39;s unruly curls, young Lucinda mutilates her treasure beyond repair. Neither of these coming-of-age stories quite explains how the grownup Oscar and Lucinda each develop a guilty passion for gambling. Oscar plays the horses while at school, and Lucinda, now an orphaned heiress, finds comfort in a game of cards with an odd collection of acquaintances. When the two finally meet, on board a ship bound for New South Wales, they are bound by their affinity for risk, their loneliness, and their awkwardly blossoming (but unexpressed) mutual affection. Their final high-stakes folly--transporting a crystal palace of a church across (literally) godforsaken terrain--strains plausibility, and events turn ghastly as Oscar plays out his bid for Lucinda&#39;s heart. Yet even the unconvincing plot turns are made up for by Carey&#39;s rich prose and the tale&#39;s unpredictable outcome. Although love proves to be the ultimate gamble for Oscar and Lucinda, the story never strays too far from the terrible possibility that even the most thunderstruck lovers can remain isolated in parallel lives.Winner of the 1988 Booker Prize, this striking novel, set in Victorian England and Australia but told with a contemporary perspective, depicts the fatal and unrequited love shared by two remarkable misfits.</p><h2>Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate</h2><p><p>Twenty-five years ago, after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency, Gerald Ford promised a return to normalcy. "My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over," President Ford declared. </p><p> But it was not. The Watergate scandal, and the remedies against future abuses of power, would have an enduring impact on presidents and the country. In <i>Shadow,</i> Bob Woodward takes us deep into the administrations of Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton to describe how each discovered that the presidency was forever altered. With special emphasis on the human toll, Woodward shows the consequences of the new ethics laws, and the emboldened Congress and media. Powerful investigations increasingly stripped away the privacy and protections once expected by the nation's chief executive. </p><p> Using presidential documents, diaries, prosecutorial records and hundreds of interviews with firsthand witnesses, Woodward chronicles how all five men failed first to understand and then to manage the inquisitorial environment. </p><p> "The mood was mean," Gerald Ford says. Woodward explains how Ford believed he had been offered a deal to pardon Nixon, then clumsily rejected it and later withheld all the details from Congress and the public, leaving lasting suspicions that compromised his years in the White House. </p><p> Jimmy Carter used Watergate to win an election, and then watched in bewilderment as the rules of strict accountability engulfed his budget director, Bert Lance, and challenged his own credibility. From his public pronouncements to the Iranian hostage crisis, Carter never found the decisive, healing style of leadership the first elected post-Watergate president had promised. </p><p> Woodward also provides the first behind-the-scenes account of how President Reagan and a special team of more than 60 attorneys and archivists beat Iran-contra. They turned the Reagan White House and United States intelligence agencies upside down investigating the president with orders to disclose any incriminating information they found. A fresh portrait of an engaged Reagan emerges as he realizes his presidency is in peril and attempts to prove his innocence. </p><p> In <i>Shadow,</i> a bitter and disoriented President Bush routinely pours out his anger at the permanent scandal culture to his personal diary as a dozen investigations touch some of those closest to him. At one point, Bush pounds a plastic mallet on his Oval Office desk because of the continuing investigation of Iran-contra Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh. "Take that, Walsh!" he shouts. "I'd like to get rid of this guy." Woodward also reveals why Bush avoided telling one of the remaining secrets of the Gulf War. </p><p> The second half of <i>Shadow</i> focuses on President Clinton's scandals. Woodward shows how and why Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation became a state of permanent war with the Clintons. He reveals who Clinton really feared in the Paula Jones case, and the behind-the-scenes maneuvering and ruthless, cynical legal strategies to protect the Clintons. <i>Shadow</i> also describes how impeachment affected Clinton's war decisions and scarred his life, his marriage and his presidency. "How can I go on?" First Lady Hillary Clinton asked in 1996, when she was under scrutiny by Starr and the media, two years before the Lewinsky scandal broke. "How can I?" </p><p> <i>Shadow</i> is an authoritative, unsettling narrative of the modern, beleaguered presidency.</p></p><p>There are two ways to look at this bestseller by Watergate scoopmeister Woodward. First, it's an original take on Clinton's sex scandal, framing it as the latest consequence of Nixon's assault on the U.S. political system. Woodward sketches each president's tussles with scandal managing after Watergate permanently turned up the press heat on the White House. Ford lies about a meeting concerning a potential deal to pardon Nixon, but remains convinced he did nothing wrong. Carter's pious advocacy of truth telling backfires when he's confronted with conundrums involving his pal Bert Lance, the fallout from CIA-provided hookers, and cash for King Hussein. Reagan's men try to make him understand the lies and shocking wrongness of the Iran-Contra debacle, but he simply, stubbornly doesn't get it. And by the time prosecutors interview Reagan in 1992, he's so ill he can't remember his own oldest friends and advisers.<p> All provocative stuff, some of it new. But most readers will flip to the book's second half, a fly-on-the-wall account of the backroom mud-wrestling in both the Clinton and Starr camps in the Monicagate morass. It's a trove of racy facts (mostly from anonymous sources). We read that Clinton called Nixon a "war criminal," yet tried to minimize Watergate in his Nixon eulogy, that he disgusted Ford and Jack Nicklaus by cheating while golfing with them, and that he kept falsely assuring aides, "I'm retired! [as an adulterer]." We hear Hillary's alleged words of agony and see the pain on Bill's face after Chelsea reads <i>The Starr Report</i> on the Internet. Starr comes off like RoboCop without the human side. Woodward calls him "pathetic and unwise" in rejecting his staff's urgent demand not to send the lurid details of presidential sex to Congress. "I love the narrative!" Starr weirdly exulted, according to Woodward's new Deep Throat (or Throats). Since Monica was interrogated at Starr's mother-in-law's apartment, which he called "Grandma's place," ethics expert Sam Dash suggested they call it "Operation Red Riding Hood." What sharp teeth everyone in this book has! </p><p> To tell the truth, Woodward doesn't really knit together 25 years' worth of scandals into a single strong narrative. But the Clinton part is the closest thing yet to what we all crave: a tale of Monicagate with some of the flavor of a John Grisham thriller. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>Bob Woodward</b> is an assistant managing editor of <i>The Washington Post.</i> He has authored or co-authored eight national bestsellers: <i>All the President's Men</i> and <i>The Final Days</i> with Carl Bernstein, <i>The Brethren</i> with Scott Armstrong, <i>Wired, Veil, The Commanders, The Agenda</i> and <i>The Choice.</i> Woodward lives in Washington, DC with his wife, Elsa Walsh, a writer for <i>The New Yorker.</i></p><h2>Perpetrators Victims Bystanders: The Jewish Catastrophe, 1933-1945</h2><p>A narrative of the Nazis&#39; destruction of European Jewry in the twentieth century discusses the victims, the killers, and those who saw but did nothing. By the author of The Destruction of the European Jews. 35,000 first printing. $35,000 ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Blending capsule portraits with unemotional analysis, eminent historian Hilberg ( The Destruction of the European Jews ) gives names, faces and identites to the agents, victims, collaborators and helpless or compromised witnesses of the Holocaust. In short chapters, he explores the diverse fates of Jews who perished and of the half-million Jewish refugees who fled Germany; of intermarried Jews and those made Jewish by decree; of children, resisters and suicides. Among the leaders of the Jewish councils, which were conduits for Nazi control and for victims' petitions, Hilberg identifies crisis managers, dictators and traditional superintendents. He profiles various types of Nazi perpetrators--zealots, perfectionists, sadistic vulgarians and those with misgivings. With meticulous documentation he probes the inaction of the Western Allies in the face of the Holocaust, the long silence of church leaders, particularly Pope Pius XII, and the complicity of those Austrians, Dutch, Croats, Romanians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians and others who abetted the Nazis. This understated, provocative work opens with a profile of the chief perpetrator, Hitler. Hilberg's calm detachment gives this portrait gallery its cumulative power. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.The dean of Holocaust historians, Hilberg is noted for his monumental history, The Destruction of the European Jews , first published 31 years ago and recently revised (Holmes &amp; Meier, 1985) in both a three-volume set and a single-volume abridgment. Altogether, it was a work of massive scholarship. Hilberg's intent in this book of essays, or "modules," as Hilberg calls them, is different. Written for the general reader, the essays are relatively short and straightforward, and they do not need to be read consecutively. Hilberg addresses many issues arranged under the three general topics given in the title. His prose sometimes suffers from a certain flatness, but it is still a powerful experience to read a historian so knowledgeable and so steeped in his sources.

In it, and in the three &#34;Discourses&#34; printed with it in this book, Rousseau discusses the nature of liberty, human rights and the state; the origins of private property; the function of education; the economic structure of society; and the relationship between individuals and the community. This revised re-issue of G.D.H. Cole&#39;s translation includes sections from the first manuscript draft of the text and is accompanied by an introduction, chronology and bibliography prepared by Professor Alan Ryan.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.Holding men in wretched subservience, feudalism --- alongside religion --- was a powerful force in the eighteenth century. Self-serving monarchic social systems, which collectively reduced common people to servitude, were now attacked by Enlightenment philosophers, of whom Rousseau was a leading light. His masterpiece, The Social Contract, profoundly influenced the subsequent development of society and remains provocative in a modern age of continuing widespread vested interest.</p><h2>A Wedding Gift: And Other Angling Stories</h2><p>Three delightful stories star the late John Foote&#39;s notorious fly-fishing addict George Baldwin Potter, who is unable to believe others are not as interested in dry-fly fishing as he. Includes special introductions to each story, plus a next-generation story by John Foote&#39;s son Timothy.</p><p>Here are John Taintor Foote's three classic - and irresistible - stories about that notorious fly-fishing addict, George Baldwin Potter: "A Wedding Gift," "Fatal Gesture," and "Daughter of Delilah."In the title story, Potter, at forty, marries a charming young woman. Always unable to believe that others are not as interested in dry-fly fishing as he is, for their honeymoon he takes her (and his prized Spinoza fly rod) to the backwoods of Maine. What follows, in this and the other stories, is marital and fishing mayhem - and perhaps disaster.Timothy Foote, John Taintor Foote's son, has added to his collection an unpublished story of his own, "The Lock Ness Monster," about George Baldwin Potter's son - and a life almost blasted by fly fishing.In all, this collection of three classic stories, the special introductions to each (which give some hitherto unknown details about the author's marriage and life, as they relate to the stories), and the next-generation story by Timothy Foote make a unique and perfectly delightful book.The charm of the little volume is enhanced by the decorative drawings by Gordon Allen. (53/4 X 81/2, 132 pages, illustrations)<br>Timothy Foote, an editor at Smithsonian magazine, has packaged three of his late father's fly-fishing tales from the '20s and '30s, all featuring the diehard fisherman George Baldwin Potter and his wife, Isabelle, 20 years George's junior. Isabelle's interests do not include fishing, and George's angling passion fuels some marital spats, here recorded by an urbane first-person narrator. In the title piece, for example, 40-year-old George takes Isabelle on a honeymoon cum fishing trip, and the results are cozily catastrophic. Foote pere, a playwright and screenwriter, has undeniable charm, but he is bound by the conventions of his time--and made to seem quainter still by Foote fils's fond prefaces. The latter adds his own story, about the son of the Potters, recounted by a fellow who is the son of the previous narrator. Devoted anglers may relish the copious fishing details and those who think filial piety a literary virtue will embrace this slender book; most others will want fresher bait. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ready, Set, Grow!: 3 Conversations That Will Bring Lasting Growth to Your Church</h2><p>In the American church, we talk a lot about developing leaders, but few pastors have a real strategy to turn willing workers into dynamic multipliers. Scott Wilson is one of those few. God gave Scott a vision and a plan for his staff and volunteers. It wasn&#39;t a quick fix. The strategy took three years, and it had plenty of bumps in the road. At the end, though, the leaders of his church were more inspired, challenged, and equipped than ever before. Their lives, their church, and their community will never be the same. The principles and practices in this book aren&#39;t a magic formula, and they aren&#39;t a rigid code. They are profound guidelines for pastors to adopt and adapt so they can build a new culture that equips leaders at all levels and celebrates the right things.</p><p>Scott Wilson has been in full-time pastoral ministry for more than twenty years. He is the senior pastor of the Oaks Fellowship in Dallas, Texas. Scott is the CEO and founder of Scott Wilson Consulting, an organization that exists to work alongside churches and marketplace leaders to enable them to achieve the full potential of what God has called them to do. Scott and his father, Dr. Tom Wilson, lead one of the most innovative public school systems in the state of Texas. Life School currently educates over four thousand students in five locations in the Dallas area. Under Scott&#39;s visionary leadership, the Oaks School of Leadership was founded in 1998. This school of ministry is in partnership with the Southwestern Assembly of God University in Waxahachie, Texas, and all students receive up to forty-eight university credit hours over a two-year period and are eligible for grants and loans like any other major university.</p><h2>Land in California: The Story of Mission Lands, Ranchos, Squatters, Mining Claims, Railroad Grants, Land Scrip, Homesteads</h2><p>The story of California can be told in terms of its land. Better still, it can be told in terms of men and women claiming the land. These men and women form a procession that begins in prehistory and comes down to the present moment.&nbsp;Heading the procession are Indians, stemming out of a mysterious past, speaking a babel of tongues, and laying claims to certain hunting, fishing, and acorn-gathering areas-possessory claims doomed to fade quickly before conquering white races.&nbsp;Following the brown-skinned Indians are Spanish speaking soldiers, settlers, and missionaries who, in 1769, began coming up through Lower California and taking over the fertile coast valleys and the harbors of California. Their laws were the Laws of the Indies controlling Spanish colonization and governing ownership of land. Missions, presidios, pueblos, and ranchos were born in the period of these people.</p><p>"A writer of great warmth and skill ... Robinson has taken the complicated business of land titles and, without generalizing or avoiding statistics, he has done the unbelievable-made a story any reader will be unable to put down. Here are the original owners, who had no land titles except those from the Great Spirit; the mission priests and their overseeing of Indian lands; the presidios and pueblos; the great Spanish and Mexican land grants and how they were torn away from the dons piecemeal by loan sharks, squatters. Here came thieves and adventurers (with a few notable exceptions, such as Don Abel Stearns, the Yankee was a highwayman) swarming the pastoral lands; mining claims and railroad grants; homesteads; tidelands; and, in quite recent years, the renewed effort at showing the land grants to be worthless ... Here, too, are personal stories of men and women engaged in that vast struggle, often bloody and violent."--<i>Los Angeles Times</i>&nbsp;"A scholarly and thorough treatment ... 'Land in California' merits serious consideration. W.W. Robinson [was] vice president of Title Insurance and Trust Co., Los Angeles, and his professional interest in land and its ownership has led to a comprehensive study of California properties from the Spanish grants to the sharply-criticized decision of the United States Supreme Court on the 'marginal lands' along the coast. Students of California history will find much of absorbing interest in Mr. Robinson's book .... 'Land in California' is a valuable contribution to Californiana and will be read carefully by everyone who is interested in the state and its development."--<i>New York Times</i><b>William Wilcox Robinson </b>(1891-1972) wrote many pamphlets, articles, and books on Southern California history, including: <i>Ranchos Become Cities</i> (1939), <i>Land in California</i> (1948), <i>Los Angeles, a Profile </i>(1968), and <i>Bombs and Bribery</i> (1969).&nbsp;</p><h2>Zahhak: The Legend Of The Serpent King</h2><p><br><b>2018 Meggendorfer Prize winner&nbsp;for the best pop up book.<br>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Hot on the heels of the coloring book for grown-ups trend comes this pop-up book, a retelling of a Persian tale.</b><br> For the first time ever, a tale from the Persian Book of Kings springs to life in this stunningly produced and ingeniously crafted pop-up book. <i>Zahhak: The Legend of the Serpent King retells the myth of the misguided Prince Zahhak who is easily swayed by the devil to murder his father and usurp the throne.

Then the young family was torn apart. Each took a girl and boy and went their separate ways&#x2014;never to see one another again. Brian is stunned to return home from a mission to find all the siblings reunited at their mother's Texas ranch. He has never forgotten Belle or how much he loved her. Will unanswered questions stand in the way of this family finding their long-awaited second chance?<br><br></p><p>Jillian Hart grew up on the original homestead where her family still lives, went to high school where <em>Twin Peaks</em> was filmed, earned an English degree, and has travelled extensively. When Jillian&#x2019;s not writing her stories, she reads, stops for caf� mochas, and hikes through the pine forests near her home in Washington State.Dr . Brian Wallace plucked the ceramic frog out of the flower bed, tipped it upside down and shook hard. The spare front-door key fell onto his palm as he squinted into the watery afternoon sun. It was good to be home. Late November air crisped over him and he shivered, goose bumps traveling down his arms. Weak from an extended illness, he gripped the railing to steady himself. The long trip from rural Texas had taken a toll on him.<p>The old adage There's No Worse Patient Than a Doctor had never been more true, he thought, as he struggled up the stairs. Easily winded, he paused a moment at the top, thanking God he was here to see the colors of sunset. His near brush with death had marked him. He couldn't deny it. He'd missed his life here in Fort Worth. He missed his kids&#x2014;although they were grown, they were what he had left of his heart.</p><p>He ambled to the door, leaned heavily against the wall and inserted the key. The door creaked open. Every part of him vibrated with a mix of weakness and exhaustion. As he crossed the threshold into the comfort of the house, memories surrounded him. It had been years since his children had lived here, but he recalled the pound of music from an upstairs bedroom, the chatter of his daughter on her phone, the drum of feet as one of the boys prowled the kitchen.</p><p>Emotion dug into his chest, claws sharp. Yes, looking death in the face changed a man. It stripped away everything extraneous, leaving what mattered most.</p><p>His footsteps echoed in the lonely living room. He eased onto a couch cushion, sighing heavily as fatigue washed over him like water. Maybe he should have listened to his colleague&#x2014;he'd valued Dr. Travors's expertise, which had saved his life&#x2014;but he'd had enough bed rest. He needed to get home; he needed to be here. The Lord had put a deep call into his heart. He couldn't explain it as he reached for the phone to try his children again. He needed to see them.</p><p>He dialed his daughter's number first. Dear Maddie. Many things had crossed his mind while he'd lain on a spare cot in the corner of a migrant worker's temporary home&#x2014;a shack beside many others on a remote Texas farm. His failings and regrets hit hard, but none as cruelly as his missteps in his personal relationships. He'd always had a difficult time opening up. He had to try to fix that. He'd been given a second chance.</p><p>He waited for the call to connect. A muffled ringing came from what sounded like his front porch. The bell pealed, boots thumped on the front step and joy launched him from the couch. He set down the phone, listening to the faint conversation on the other side of the door. His kids were here? Theirs were the voices he'd missed during his illness, the ones he'd most longed to hear. He gripped the brass knob, tugged and set eyes on his children. All three of them.</p><p><i>Praise the Lord, for bringing them here safe and sound.</i> "You got my messages."</p><p>"You left about a dozen." Maddie tumbled into his arms. "Dad, you have no idea how good it is to see you. No idea."</p><p>"Right back at you, sweetheart." The endearment stumbled off his tongue&#x2014;he wasn't good with them&#x2014;but he had to get better at speaking his feelings. He had to try harder. His dear Maddie, so like her mother. His chest ached with affections too intense to handle, so he swallowed hard, trying to tamp them down as he held her hands in his after their hug was done. "I was gone a little longer than I'd planned this time&#x2014;"</p><p>"A little?" Her voice shot up. "Dad, you have no idea how worried sick we've been over you."</p><p>"I don't even know how to say how sorry I am&#x2014;"</p><p>"What matters is that you're all right." Her hands gave his a warm, understanding squeeze.</p><p>"Where have you been?" Grayson, his oldest child, stepped in to join the reunion. Tall, dark and handsome. Pride swelled up, making it hard to look at the boy properly.</p><p>"Grayson." Those couldn't be tears in his eyes, of course not. Brian wasn't a man given to tears. Maybe because he had thought of his two other children when he'd been fighting for his life on that cot. Yet another son and daughter, lost to him forever. His biggest regret of all. Emotion clumped in his throat, making it impossible to say more.</p><p>"We've been looking for you." Grayson's hug was brief, his face fighting emotion, too. "We found your wallet in a ditch and we feared you were missing. The police&#x2014;"</p><p>"Missing?" He swiped a hand over his face, grimacing, hating what he'd put them through. "I was in rural Texas, you know that, sometimes without phones or cell service. I would have gotten a message to you kids, but I lost my cell&#x2014;"</p><p>"I know. We found your phone, too." Carter, his youngest from his second marriage, stepped in, healthy and whole, back from war. "We were afraid you'd gotten ill. Are you all right, Dad?"</p><p>"Now I am." He wrapped his arms around Carter, holding him tight. When he ended the hug, he held on, drinking in the sight of the boy&#x2014;okay, he was twenty-three, but Carter would always be his youngest, a seasoned soldier home from deployment safely. When Brian let go, it was hard to see again. He was grateful to God for returning his youngest son home unharmed.</p><p>"We heard you caught a virulent strain of strep." Carter ambled into the living room, making himself at home.</p><p>"And that you'd been treating a family who were dangerously ill." Grayson headed straight for the couch.</p><p>"We feared the worst, Dad." Beautiful Maddie with her auburn hair and a stylish fashion sense swept through the doorway, anguish carved into her dear face.</p><p>"I never meant to worry you." He shut the door, swallowing hard. His case had been severe and there'd been days, even weeks, where it hadn't been certain he would live. He didn't know what to do with the emotions coiled in his chest, so he shrugged, tried to play things down. "I survived, so it wasn't so bad."</p><p>"This is just like you. Always keeping us out instead of letting us in." Maddie sounded upset, on the verge of anger or tears, maybe both.</p><p>He hated upsetting her. Frustrated at himself, he crossed his arms over his chest. <i>Remember your vow,</i></p><p><i>Brian. You have to try harder.</i> "I didn't mean it that way, honey. There's nothing to worry about now. I'm on the mend. That you kids are here, that you came, means everything."</p><p>It wasn't easy, but he got out the words.</p><p>"Oh, Daddy." Maddie swiped her eyes. "Don't you dare make me cry. I'm choked up enough already."</p><p>"What do you mean? What's got you choked up? Is something going on?"</p><p>"Dad, you'd better sit down for this." Grayson patted the seat beside him.</p><p>"This can't be good." He studied Carter's serious face and the troubled crinkles around Grayson's eyes. "Something happened while I was gone. That's why you were trying to reach me?"</p><p>"It's not bad news, but it could give you a real shock." Grayson cleared his throat, waiting until Brian eased onto the cushion. "There's no easy way to say this, so I'm just going to do it. We found Mom."</p><p>"Uh..." Brian's brain screeched to a halt, unable to make sense of those words. He was hearing things. No doubt due to his exhaustion and weakened state. "Sorry...say that again? Your mom's buried. She died when Carter was three. You remember the car accident."</p><p>"Not Sharla, Dad. Our real mother, at least for Gray-son and me," Maddie added.</p><p>"Your real...? <i>What?"</i> That's as far as he got. The mention of the mother of his other son and daughter floored him. How could they know? All they could remember was Sharla, his second wife, the woman he'd married when the kids were very young. "Wait a minute. I don't understand. You're not making any sense."</p><p>"I know it's a shock for you, Daddy." Maddie settled on the couch across from him. "But it's true. Take a deep breath. I found our birth mother."</p><p>"No." He shook his head, refusing to see how that was possible. The only person Maddie could be talking about was Isabella...his first wife, his high school sweetheart, the woman who'd broken his faith in true love.</p><p>"I found Violet&#x2014;" she began.</p><p>"Violet?" He blinked, his brain spinning.</p><p>"Thanks to a lucky coincidence, Violet and I came face-to-face in a coffee shop and I found Mom from there." Maddie's hands cradled his.</p><p>Isabella was gone, tucked away in the Witness Protection Program with their two other children, never to be seen again. Their lives depended on it. "My mind's playing tricks on me because I thought you said&#x2014;"</p><p>"Yes, I did. Mom is in Grasslands, and we're all together. Violet and Jack, well, they used to be Laurel and Tanner."</p><p>Laurel? Tanner? He shuddered, fighting the memory welling up of the U.S. Marshal driving away in a black SUV. Isabella in the window, cradling a six-month-old in her arms, and a little chestnut-haired boy, just two, waving bye-bye.</p><p>He swallowed hard. His lost children were here, in Texas. In Grasslands? <i>Within driving distance?</i> All this time he'd grieved for them, missed them with his entire heart for twenty-five years and now the two sets of twins were reunited? They'd found one another?</p><p>No, he shook his head, refusing to believe it. It couldn't be true. The hardest thing he'd ever done was let them go. But he'd had to make an impossible choice to protect his family from unspeakable danger.</p><p>"We're together now, Dad." Maddie's happiness was real. Her hands around his were real. "The only one missing is you."</p><p>Her words finally sank in. Realization crashed over him like a cold ocean wave, washing away disbelief.</p><p>This was r...</p></p><h2>Haruki Murakami&#39;s The Wind-up Bird Chronicle: A Reader&#39;s Guide (Continuum Contemporaries)</h2><p>This is an excellent guide to Haruki Murakami&#39;s extraordinary novel.

The Warden&#x2019;s insignia on the center chest was less overt than the Justice Department preferred, but as the Strike Teams were considerably more overt than the Justice Department preferred, Torin figured it balanced in the end. The helmet made use of H&#x2019;san technology and held two different shapes; down the back like an empty bag and snapped up over the head into a rigid polarized sphere. Helmet up, the suit could support the tanks by filtering any combination of external oxygen and nitrogen into something essentially breathable. It recycled all fluids almost indefinitely. Self-contained, the suits were comfortable for six hours, livable for eight, and, if breathing remained an option, became progressively nastier after that.<br><br>If all went well, they&#x2019;d be out of the suits before the plumbing had a chance to recycle the morning&#x2019;s pouch of coffee.<br><br>Torin didn&#x2019;t expect it to go well.

Suits secured, she checked with Binti and the two Krai, then turned toward the control panel. &#x201c;Ready when you are.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be in position in five,&#x201d; Craig told her. &#x201c;Opening inner airlock door.&#x201d;<br><br>The airlock opened into the control room. Back when Craig Ryder had been a Civilian Salvage Operator, the control room had been the <i>Promise</i>&#x2019;s single cabin, the greater part of the ship the Susumi drive. Justice had upgraded and expanded the <i>Promise </i>when she&#x2019;d nearly been destroyed by pirates, adding the ability to attach packets as needed, but she remained Craig&#x2019;s ship. The other Strike Team pilots flew decommissioned Navy Corvettes&#x2014;the smallest Naval vessel with a Susumi drive. The other Strike Team pilots would have shit themselves before ghosting into docking position on a gas giant mining station using momentum and air jets and hard-earned skill.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re still a surprise, Boss,&#x201d; Alamber called from the second seat as the inner door opened and Torin led the four suited members of her team into the airlock. &#x201c;Speed matched to within five point seven kilometers an hour. Exit in seven minutes . . . mark.&#x201d;<br><br>The countdown appeared on the lower right curve of her helmet.<br><br>The inner door sealed, and the pressure began to equalize.<br><br>&#x201c;You really think we can take back the station with six people, Gunny?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How many people do we have?&#x201d;<br><br>Behind the lightly polarized surface of her helmet, Binti&#x2019;s brows rose. &#x201c;Six.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll take back the station with six people.&#x201d;<br><br>There&#x2019;d been a rise in violence in Sector Seven&#x2014;in MidSector as well as OutSector&#x2014;spreading the Strike Teams thin, preventing them from doubling up. Torin would have preferred to take more Wardens into the pirate-held station, but as there weren&#x2019;t any available, her preferences were moot.<br><br>The six of them, in pre-Strike Team Alpha days, had taken down an entire pirate fleet. A single ship draining the tanks at a Mictok-run mining station should be a walk in the cake. Torin frowned. Maybe not cake. Pie? Not for the first time, she missed the late Sergeant Hollice and his command of oldEarth idiom.<br><br>Over the last five tendays, three other mining stations had been hit, quick and quiet, the Wardens informed after the fact. The violence had been minimal by Torin&#x2019;s standards, but two Mictok and a Bril had been killed. The Elder Races hadn&#x2019;t fought back because the Elder Races didn&#x2019;t fight back, which was one of the reasons the strike teams existed&#x2014;the Younger Races cleaning up the damage done to their three species over the long years of the war. That said, everyone agreed the Bril&#x2019;s death had been accidental. They were a strangely fragile species with some of their important parts in unexpected places. Informed of the previous attacks, the manager of Mictok Station Trilik had adopted the very non-Mictok attitude of assuming the worst and had deployed long-range scanners. The moment the scanners had picked up an unscheduled tanker in-system, they&#x2019;d sent a message to Berbar Station, the Justice headquarters in Seventh Sector and evacuated all but essential personnel, fully aware that had they waited until the tanker came close enough to identify, it would have been too late. The pirates would have blocked the signal.<br><br>Having noticed ships leaving the station en masse, smart pirates would have headed for home. Perhaps the pirates thought the Mictok&#x2014;who had close to a monopoly on mining the Confederation&#x2019;s gas giants&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t shared information about the previous attacks. Perhaps they thought the Mictok would be embarrassed to send for help before they knew for certain they needed it. Perhaps they&#x2019;d never actually spoken to a Mictok, as Torin didn&#x2019;t think it was possible to embarrass one of the giant spiders. Perhaps, after three successful robberies, they&#x2019;d gotten cocky. There hadn&#x2019;t been resistance, so there wouldn&#x2019;t be resistance.<br><br>Wrong.<br><br>Three minutes.<br><br>With the pressure equalized, the outer airlock door opened.<br><br>One minute.<br><br>&#x201c;Speed matched to within six meters per hour. Five. Four. Three . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On my word.&#x201d; Torin watched the seconds count down.<br><br>&#x201c;Speed matched.&#x201d;<br><br>Three. Two . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Go! Go! Go!&#x201d;<br><br>The <i>Promise</i> was one hundred and one meters from the station&#x2014;one meter closer and the station&#x2019;s docking computers would have taken over, announcing their approach. Craig could have nestled his ship up to the airlock&#x2014;to any airlock&#x2014;without help, but the Mictok insisted on safety first, most likely because a good seventy percent of the gas they mined was combustible. Thirty percent of the seventy was highly combustible. The potential for disaster put the docking arm used for the arrival and departure of personnel on the opposite side of the station from the gas giant, the bulk of the station a shield against the planetary storms and the tanks filled with potential explosives. This also put the airlock the Strike Team was heading for on the opposite side from the tanks and the pirates emptying them.<br><br>On the one hand, they were less likely to be seen.<br><br>On the other, they had the entire width of the station to cross once inside.<br><br>Torin unmagged her boots three meters before she hit metal, twisting and allowing the much less powerful magnets in her gloves to make first contact, preventing eighty-six accelerating kilograms from slamming into the station and setting off an impact alarm. The piercing, panic-inducing nature of the alarm meant no one, on any station, wanted the sensors reacting to every passing piece of space debris so only those large enough, fast enough, or solid enough to damage the outer hull set off the klaxons. These large, fast, and solid measurements were consistent across the Confederation and, for all Torin&#x2019;s comments about the Navy, the entire boarding party had done this before. A few meters to the right, Ressk filled her peripheral vision. Werst touched down above them, his head to theirs. Binti&#x2019;s aim had put her close enough to the airlock controls she had to shift to the left when Ressk hand-walked over.<br><br>No one expected people to cross vacuum and open the door. No one set alarms for the unexpected.<br><br>On the other hand, as no one wanted personnel trapped outside a station should the worst happen, the emergency access codes for the airlocks were also consistent across the Confederation.<br><br>Torin believed the definition of <i>the worst</i> needed changing.<br><br>By the time Ressk had keyed in the access codes and the outer door had begun to open, they&#x2019;d all moved close enough to quickly slip inside.<br><br>The inner door opened automatically when the pressure equalized, reminding Torin of how few Primacy attacks had come this far into the MidSectors.<br><br><i>*All life signs still gathered at the tanks, Boss&#x2014;six Human, two Miktok.*</i><br><br>Humans had been the only species positively identified by survivors at the other stripped stations. &#x201c;Please tell me the two life signs still on the pirate ship aren&#x2019;t Human.&#x201d;<br><br><i>*Wish I could, Boss, but the ship has a hard shell up and I can&#x2019;t get more than the basics. The happy making news is that I&#x2019;ve got clean air and, even happier, no one&#x2019;s monitoring the station sysop. You&#x2019;re clear to advance.*</i><br><br>&#x201c;You heard him, people.&#x201d; Torin unsealed her helmet, rigidity releasing as it dropped down her back. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br><br>Sergeants and above came out of both branches of the military with communication implants set into their jawbone. About two thirds of the Strike Team personnel had arrived with implants, and Justice had offered installations to the rest. Weapons used during the thefts at the earlier stations raised the odds the pirates were ex-military although there&#x2019;d been no other identifiers. Once they had the stations locked down, they transferred the contents of the storage tanks, and were gone&#x2014;no images, no sounds, no DNA left behind. If the assumption of a military background was correct, a percentage of the pirates had to have implants, opening a way for the Strike Teams to eavesdrop or jack in and use the technology as a weapon.<br><br>This trip out, Alamber had been unable to locate a signal.<br><br>With Mictok held hostage, they were left with no option but to put boots on deck and do it the hard way.<br><br>Out of the docking arm, the corridors through the station were wide and well lit, the bulkheads covered in the art the Mictok were admired for throughout the Confederation. Considering that a high percentage of Confederate species were mammals and the Mictok most decidedly were not, that either made art a universal language or art critics as a subspecies listened to their hindbrains and refused to piss the Mictok off. Torin glanced over at the thick ridges of color and decided it was likely six of one, half a dozen of the other.<br><br>Excluding the tanks and the docking arms, the station was round; eight main corridors headed diagonally from the rim into a central space. Their path took them in, across the center, and out. Fast and easy. Except that the central space had been filled with webbing. Going around meant backtracking and making their way through side corridors that hadn&#x2019;t been designed for the convenience of bipedal visitors.<br><br>&#x201c;Fuk me,&#x201d; Werst muttered.<br><br>As they approached, Torin studied the thick white cables laid out in an obvious path through the middle of the web and knew if she stopped on the edge, she might not get going again. Knew that if she kept running, so would her team.<br><br>&#x201c;You know, without boots,&#x201d; Ressk began just behind her left hip.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Krai feet were almost as flexible as their hands, and Ressk wasn&#x2019;t wrong; without their boots they could cross the webbing as quickly as a Mictok, but no one skimmed out of an HE suit. If they&#x2019;d had that kind of time, they could&#x2019;ve gone around.<br><br>The web flexed as Torin landed on it, one boot on one cable, the other on an identical cable fifteen centimeters away. A continuation of the main corridor design for visiting bipeds, the cables had been connected by a thinner cable in a pattern woven too closely to slip through. Slipping <i>off</i> didn&#x2019;t appear to have been considered. Mictok didn&#x2019;t slip. The cables rose and fell under Torin&#x2019;s boots, the undulations rhythmic enough she could keep her balance.<br><br>Until Ressk joined her. Just over a meter high, he was heavier than he looked, and his shorter stride on the cables set up a competing rhythm. When Binti joined them, the cable went up where a stride before it had gone down. Torin&#x2019;s right leg sank knee-deep into the interior webbing before springing back up again with enough force her knee nearly smacked her in the chin. She&#x2019;d have fallen had the gravity not been a third less than she was used to and had Ressk not grabbed the loop of strapping at her hip and thrown his weight against it.<br><br>The whole web rippled.<br><br>&#x201c;Werst . . .&#x201d; She swayed, but regained her balance. &#x201c;. . . implant cadence. Double-time.&#x201d;<br><br>From the back of the march&#x2014;historically, pre-implant, the position most likely to be heard, codified over the centuries by the militaries of all three Younger Races&#x2014;Werst began a mouth-closed hum, laying down a rhythm they&#x2019;d all been trained to follow. A rhythm that let their feet move without any interference from their brains.<br><br><i>It&#x2019;s too narrow.</i><br><br><i>It&#x2019;s wobbling.</i><br><br><i>It&#x2019;s a web!</i><br><br>Which was not to say Torin&#x2019;s brain, at least, didn&#x2019;t try.<br><br>&#x201c;That was fun,&#x201d; Binti forced out through clenched teeth as she reached the other side. &#x201c;I vote we strip to our skivvies and travel through the cold, merciless vacuum of space on the way back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Be a lot easier without boots,&#x201d; Ressk agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;Missing my point,&#x201d; Binti told him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a spider thing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Human spider thing,&#x201d; Werst grunted, jumping up onto the deck beside his bonded.<br><br><i>*I saw that vid. I didn&#x2019;t get how they could have missed the obvious thing to do with eight arms.*</i><br><br>&#x201c;Alamber . . .&#x201d; A di&#x2019;Taykan could turn anything to innuendo. And, if given the chance, usually did. That said, he had a point about the eight arms.<br><br><i>*Still a clear run to the tanks, Boss.*</i><br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go, people.&#x201d;<br><br>The control room for the mining operation took up about a third of the arc facing the gas giant and overlooked the two docking positions on either side of the stacked tanks. The pirates, plus the Mictok hostages, were currently in the control room. It being unlikely they&#x2019;d surrender without a fight, Torin wanted the pirates in one of the docking arms, an area designed to deal with explosive decompression.</p><h2>Japonisme Comes to America: The Japanese Impact on the Graphic Arts 1876-1925</h2><p>This is a 256 page hardback book with dust jacket titled JAPONISME COMES TO AMERICA: The Japanese Impact on the Graphic Arts 1876-1925 by Julia Meech and Gabriel P.

Right off the bat, she comes across a pig wearing sandwich boards advertising the need for a leading lady in the World Mother Goose Theatre. Jennie leaps at the opportunity. Unfortunately, the position requires someone with experience, so she sets off to find it. One hungry lion and a stubborn un-hungry baby later, Jennie definitely has experience, if nothing else anymore, and off she goes to play the leading role in a nursery-rhyme-turned-theatrical-production: <blockquote> Higglety-pigglety pop!<br> The dog has eaten the mop!<br> The pig's in a hurry<br> The cat's in a flurry<br> Higglety-pigglety pop!<br> </blockquote> This dreamy, slightly dark story, illustrated in Sendak's renowned pen-and-ink style, tells of a gluttonous dog's transformation from someone who cares only about her next salami sandwich to one who would risk her life for a weaker being (while still wondering where that next sandwich is coming from).

Five-fifty. Six hundred. Six-fifty. Seven. Seven-fifty at the back. Eight.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bidding was keen by West Country standards. Morton&#x2019;s auction house in Bath was used to lots being knocked down without much show of enthusiasm. The dealer&#x2019;s faces were giving nothing away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;A thousand.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the increments would be in hundreds. Four or five bidders were still interested and Denis Doggart, the auctioneer, needed the help of his assistants to keep track of the small movements that signified bids.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Fifteen hundred. Sixteen. Seventeen on the phone.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heads turned. Not everyone in the room had realised bids were being phoned in. This wasn&#x2019;t a sale of impressionist paintings at Sotheby&#x2019;s. It was only the regular quarterly disposal of bits brought in to the Bath office for valuation, and most of them were bric-a-brac or tat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doggart was unfazed. He had been told to expect two telephone bidders, from New York and Tokyo.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Two thousand.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opening bidder shook his head. This was beyond his top figure. But the others were still in. The price mounted steadily, in two hundreds now.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;At three thousand pounds.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A stifled gasp came from the back where some onlookers had gathered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doggart knew who the main bidders were, except one, a dark-haired man in a cream coloured linen jacket and white shirt with a red bow tie. This stranger, more than anyone, was driving the sale. A spark of determination had kindled in his blue eyes. But who the hell was he? He&#x2019;d obviously registered and been given his number. He&#x2019;d shown no interest in any of the hundred and twenty-eight lots that had gone before. Doggart would have liked to check with his clerk to learn the name, but controlling the auction demanded total concentration. <br> After three thousand, the bidding is stepped up by larger amounts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Four thousand in the front.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bow Tie Man was in it to win it.<br> A pause.<br> &#x2018;All done?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from it. A new bidder raised his card, Sturgess, a London dealer who only made the trip to Bath when the catalogue contained something exceptional.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately Bow Tie topped the bid.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interest from Japan and America had ended somewhere between three and four thousand. Sturgess and the mystery man could settle this between them. And now the bids were coming in with the pendulum precision that auctioneers love.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Five thousand, then.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who wears a bow tie these days? A few doctors and academics. The occasional eccentric. Certain auctioneers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment&#x2019;s consideration, Sturgess nodded for five thousand five.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No hesitation in the response.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Six thousand from the gentleman in the front. Are we there yet? A unique item of excellent provenance.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new, aggressive voice broke in: &#x2018;Nobody move.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shock in the room was unimaginable. When an auctioneer is at work, his voice and his alone is all anyone expects to hear. The bidding is silent. An utterance from anyone else is an outrage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If &#x201c;Nobody move&#x201d; was an order, it was not obeyed. After the collective jerk of surprise, all heads turned to see who had spoken.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A larger shock awaited. The speaker was wearing a black mask that covered his face and was holding a handgun. He must have been standing all the time against the wall within ten feet of the auctioneer. He&#x2019;d slipped on the mask and produced the gun and spoken his two words while all the attention was on the bidders.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denis Doggart, on his rostrum, was supposed to be directing the show. He turned his head and said, &#x2018;What&#x2019;s this about?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Shut up.&#x2019; The masked man said, &#x2018;Everyone stay right where you are and nobody will get hurt.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doggart said, &#x2018;This is intolerable.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I already told you to shut it.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any doubt remained how serious the situation was, it evaporated when two more masked men with guns entered the saleroom by the door facing the rostrum. They marched up the aisle that was kept clear for safety reasons and took a grip on the handle of the wooden dolly supporting lot 129, the object currently under the hammer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was too much for the bidder with the red bow tie. &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t steal that,&#x2019; he said in a shrill, appalled voice. &#x2018;Get away.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Shut up, mister,&#x2019; the first gunman said. &#x2018;Get on with it,&#x2019; he told his companions.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;It&#x2019;s under auction. I made the last bid. No one is taking it.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Let them be, sir,&#x2019; the auctioneer said. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re armed.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;They&#x2019;re not having it. It&#x2019;s too precious.&#x2019; Bow Tie was up from his chair and striding towards the men starting to shift the heavy burden. &#x2018;Get your hands off.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The steady build-up of adrenalin during the auction must have given him extra courage, blind, foolhardy anger at the crime being committed in front of everyone. He was a slight man, no match for the crooks except in strength of will. He grabbed the sleeve of the nearest and succeeded in tugging his hand away from the dolly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gunman swung around. He had the automatic in his right hand. He levelled it and squeezed the trigger.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report echoed through the auction room, deafening everyone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The force of the bullet sent Bow Tie Man crashing against a walnut table stacked with china. He hit the ground at the same time as a mass of cups, saucers and plates. Pandemonium followed, screams and shouts, some people diving for cover, others heading for the door. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The would-be thieves panicked like everyone else. Any thoughts of stealing lot 129 were abandoned without a word passing among them. All three dashed for the exit, stepping over their wounded victim.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A silver delivery van was waiting in the street outside with rear door open and a ramp in place. Two of the crooks dived in and hoisted the ramp aboard and the third slammed the door, dashed to the front and climbed in. The driver, obviously primed for the getaway, had the wheels in motion before the door closed. With a screech of rubber on tarmac, the getaway vehicle rounded the tight corners of Queen Square and was gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside the auction room fumes of cordite hung in the air.

Whoever had lifted it on was probably nursing a back strain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Can you make out what it is?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it supposed to be someone on horseback?&#x2019; Ingeborg said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Looks to me like a bunch of bananas.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The face of the slab had been worked by a sculptor at some time in the remote past and any detail had long since been eroded. Thanks to the build-up of centuries of grime in the chiselled areas you could conceivably make out the outline of a horse and rider, Diamond was willing to admit. If so, the horse had thick legs, which was no bad thing. Either the sculptor&#x2019;s sense of proportion was faulty or the person in the saddle was an XXL.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Does the writing give any clues?&#x2019; he asked.<br> Along the base was some damaged lettering: &#x2018;. . .

Y&nbsp; SHE&nbsp; SAT.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ingeborg shook her head. &#x2018;The last two words are all I can make out. I suppose they tell us the rider is female.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He eyed the carving again. &#x2018;You could have fooled me.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;The auction catalogue may throw some light. There must be some about.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded. &#x2018;See if you can find one while I have a word with the pathologist.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bertram Sealy in his blue zip-suit was squatting in a mass of broken china beside the body and speaking into a tape-recorder. He flapped a hand as Diamond approached. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t come any closer with your big feet.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diamond let go of the do-not-cross tape as if he had never intended to creep under it. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not new to this. First impressions?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No great loss,&#x2019; the pathologist said.<br> There was a pause. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s callous even by your standards.&#x2019;<br> &#x2018;Bits of a tea service, cheap nineteen-fifties willow pattern.

Interspersed with original insights, fresh interpretations, and bold challenges to the status quo, the stories are both entertaining and thought-provoking&#x2014;some may even appear controversial. Focusing first on laywomen from the time before the Buddha&#x2019;s enlightenment&#x2014;his birth mother and stepmother, his co-wives, and members of his harem when he was known as Prince Siddhartha&#x2014;then moving on to the Buddha&#x2019;s first female disciples, early nuns, and to female patrons, Wendy Garling invites us to open our minds to a new understanding of their roles.</p><p>Wendy Garling is a writer, mother, Buddhist practitioner, and independent scholar with a BA from Wellesley College and MA in Sanskrit language and literature from the University of California, Berkeley. She is an authorized dharma teacher and has taught women&#x2019;s spirituality with a focus on the sacred feminine and women&#x2019;s stories for many years.&#x201c;A well-researched, intelligent, and sensitive retrieval of women&#x2019;s lineage stories from the dawn of Buddhism. &nbsp;Eloquently retold, with lush quotes from the canon, these accounts animate the poignant, intimate lives of the foremothers on their journey to enlightenment. &nbsp;A welcome, much-needed addition to Buddhist literature!&#x201d;&#x2014;Judith Simmer-Brown, Naropa University, author of <i>Dakini&#x2019;s Warm Breath</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An extraordinary book, following the life span of the Buddha, as the great and brave women who brought equality to the dharma shine through rare and rich stories of their lives. This is a radical and wondrous book, shedding a new and bright light on Buddhism.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roshi Joan Halifax, Abbot, Upaya Zen Center<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An epic tale about the luminous constellation of women who from conception to death surrounded the Buddha. Straddling dream and reality, this fresh and original rendering of these remarkable women&#x2019;s stories weaves together strands of legend with verses from original texts. The colorful accounts express in contemporary language and colloquial style the deepest spiritual longings of an awakening cast of characters, at once humorous, heartwarming, and familiar.&#x201d;&#x2014;Karma Lekshe Tsomo, editor of <i>Buddhism through American Women&#x2019;s Eyes</i> and a founder of Sakyadhita: International Association of Buddhist Women&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Wendy Garling&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Stars at Dawn</i>&nbsp; retells the ancient stories of the lives of the women who were essential players in the Buddha's life in a way that supports connection and understanding. Reading Garling&#x2019;s account of the women whose lives were interwoven with the Buddha&#x2019;s, I often felt deeply inspired by everyone involved.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sharon Salzberg, author of <i>Lovingkindness</i> and <i>Real Happiness<br><br></i>"Wendy Garling's&nbsp;<i>Stars at Dawn</i>&nbsp;is a beautiful telling of the moving stories of the many important women in the life of Siddhartha Gautama who became the Shakyamuni Buddha. Of course, human beings live totally interwoven with each other, and of course every man only can exist in dependence on many important women, grandmothers, mothers, sisters, lovers, wives, daughters, etc. Their bodies come from women, they are nurtured, protected, taught, and challenged by women, and their personalities are formed, and their insights and achievements are born from the usually more advanced realism of women. So finally, Garling shows us from mostly original sources how women had determining agency in creating the Buddhist movement on this planet in this era, skillfully helping us extricate ourselves from the patriarchal version where a lone man supposedly produced perfect enlightenment on his own and started a major transformation in history all alone. She has rendered us all, Buddhists and others, a great service; her book should be a must read in courses on Buddhism and by anyone who wants to understand the Buddha. All will benefit who wake up to recognize that human life and history have always been made by all too invisible women right along with the men we usually hear about! "&#x2014;Robert Thurman, Je Tsongkhapa Professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies, Columbia University<i><br><br></i>"Wendy Garling, in her book&nbsp;Stars at Dawn,&nbsp;has made an invaluable contribution to research in early Buddhism by collecting together a vast repository of stories from various early, and some late sources, and organizing them to argue for the significance and centrality of women in the life of the Buddha. In engaging in the painstaking work of tracking down these stories she has created a resource for future scholars who may well be spurred into inquiring into the deeper significance of this seemingly &#x2018;hidden&#x2019; but certainly under researched textual tradition. What is offered is a significant and persuasive corrective to the dominant patriarchal story of the Buddha&#x2019;s life, where women have been radically excised from that story and included only where they are deemed absolutely necessary, such as his &#x2018;miraculous&#x2019; birth. This book is highly intelligent and extremely well researched and is one of those rare books that actually provokes thought, both agreement and disagreement. This is an absolute pleasure to read. "&#x2014;Dr. John Peacock, Codirector of Masters in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy, University of Oxford<i><br><br></i>"It is always good to reread old texts through new lenses. By focusing on often neglected stories about laywomen that have been sidelined in various traditions about the Buddha, Wendy Garling has produced a suggestive and insightful book. Instead of studying the biographical texts in the usual manner, from a philological, philosophical, or historical point of view, she seeks to knit together the forgotten threads of &#x201c;women&#x2019;s stories&#x201d; within them, in ways that will be relevant to the concerns of present day readers and that will bring new insights to male-bound traditional narratives about the Buddha. Engagingly written, this is a work by someone who is herself a masterful storyteller. "&#x2014;John Strong, Charles A. Dana Professor of Religion and Asian Studies, Bates College<br><i><br></i>"Buddhist storytelling embodies a vast and complicated web of narratives, and Wendy Garling&#x2019;s book,&nbsp;<i>Stars at Dawn,</i> does a wonderful job of bringing some of it to life. She pulls together narratives from a number of early sources and presents fresh retellings of the most important female characters in the Buddha&#x2019;s life. It is a wonderful accomplishment.

[Her] efforts to integrate these and other strong female characters add both tenderness and power to what has mainly been an all-male cast.

He lives in Islesford, one of the Cranberry Isles off the coast of Maine.Joyful in both word and palette, this African story tells why lightning and thunder reside in the sky and not on earth, as they once did. Ma Sheep Thunder and Son Ram Lightning live in an African village, summoning Rain by racing through the mountains at the King's request. But Son Ram Lightning gets into mischief--butting people, munching on straw hats in the marketplace, and accidentally setting a fire. The exasperated King finally banishes mother and son to the sky, where they live today except for occasional earthly forays in which frisky Lightning strikes anything in his path and his mother runs after him, calling him back home. Bryan takes a highly conversational, genial tone, with frequent interjections of "uh-huh" and "uh-uh," that quickly develops camaraderie between the reader, the narrator, the sprited ram, and his frazzled mother. Brilliantly colored and ingeniously patterned, Bryan's illustrations are a playful take on stained glass.

Is it unbounded sexual pleasure, unrestrained personal gratification of all one&#x2019;s desires? Is it quiet and solitude, individual removal from the storm and thunder of modern society? Or is it obedient Christian faith that causes spiritual corpses to burst forth with godly passion and holy worship that transforms one&#x2019;s own life, one&#x2019;s environment, and one&#x2019;s eternal destiny?<br><br>This other way of life proceeds from an ancient book that lifts life in this age and all mothers to another plane. This is the truly good life, the path plotted for the steps of mankind by almighty God. It involves sacrifice, and hardship, and hard work. It means self-denial, self-abasement, and an others-centered mindset. It is radically God-centered and deeply rooted in Scripture. This, and no other path, offers the souls of humanity lasting happiness. <br><br>For Jonathan Edwards, submission to God and His will was the path to true fulfillment and the good life.&nbsp; Easily accessible and readable, you do not need to be a scholar to enjoy these insights about Jonathan Edwards and his writings.</p><p><b>OWEN STRACHAN</b> is Associate Professor of Christian Theology at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.

For over a decade since, Harbury has used her formidable legal, research, and organizing skills to press for the U.S. government's disclosure of America's involvement in harrowing abuses in Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. A draft of this book had just been completed when the first photos from Abu Ghraib were published; tragically, many of Harbury's deepest fears about America's own abuses were graphically confirmed by those horrific images.<br><br>This urgently needed book offers both well-documented evidence of the CIA's continuous involvement in torture tactics since the 1970s and moving personal testimony from many of the victims. Most important, Harbury provides solid, convincing arguments against the use of torture in any circumstances: not only because it is completely inconsistent with all the basic values Americans hold dear, but also because it has repeatedly proved to be ineffective: Again and again,'information' obtained through these gruesome tactics proves unreliable or false. Worse, the use of torture by U.S. client states, allies, and even by our own operatives, endangers our citizens and especially our troops deployed internationally.</p><p>Jennifer K. Harbury took her law degree from Harvard. She has lived and worked with human rights activists, peasants, and Mayan villagers in Guatemala. Harbury also worked with members of the U.S. Congress and the Organization of American States to locate her husband and thirty-five other members of the Guatemalan resistance believed to be held by the military. She is the author of <i>Searching for Everardo</i> and <i>Bridge of Courage</i> and currently directs the STOP (Stop Torture Permanently) Campaign at the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee.When torture photos from Abu Ghraib became public in spring 2004, Americans reacted with revulsion: how could our military commit such horrible acts? In fact, Harbury's well-documented volume reveals, American representatives abroad have been involved in torture for decades, much of it in Central America, where U.S. agents apparently encouraged the kidnapping, maltreatment and murder of left-wing fighters and their suspected sympathizers. Harbury's own husband became one of the Guatemalan victims-she described his fate in Searching for Everardo-and this new volume alludes to his story repeatedly. Its central chapter compiles testimony from Latin American torture survivors, making a case for U.S. involvement in "torture by proxy." Harbury accompanies her evidence with passionate if unsurprising denunciations, calling torture not just inhumane and illegal but ineffective: since tortured suspects confess to anything, she says, their statements may be worth nothing. Making use of her Harvard Law training, Harbury suggests legal avenues through which even federally sanctioned torturers may be held responsible. If her book holds few surprises for those who have followed these stories closely, its cases will certainly stoke the fires of outrage.

Jones traces the development of this literature as African American writers, celebrating their oral heritage, developed distinctive literary forms.</p><p> </p><p> The twentieth century saw a new confidence and deliberateness in African American work: the move from surface use of dialect to articulation of a genuine black voice; the move from blacks portrayed for a white audience to characterization relieved of the need to justify. Innovative writing&#x2014;such as Charles Waddell Chesnutt&#x2019;s depiction of black folk culture, Langston Hughes&#x2019;s poetic use of blues, and Amiri Baraka&#x2019;s recreation of the short story as a jazz piece&#x2014;redefined Western literary tradition.</p><p> </p><p> For Jones, literary technique is never far removed from its social and political implications. She documents how literary form is inherently and intensely national, and shows how the European monopoly on acceptable forms for literary art stifled American writers both black and white. Jones is especially eloquent in describing the dilemma of the African American writers: to write from their roots yet retain a universal voice; to merge the power and fluidity of oral tradition with the structure needed for written presentation. With this work Gayl Jones has added a new dimension to African American literary history.</p><p> </p></p><p>Gayl Jones was born in Kentucky in 1949. She attended Connecticut College and Brown University, and has taught a Wellesley College and the University of Michigan. Her other books include THE HEALING (1998 National Book Award Finalist and New York Times Notable Book of the Year) and many others.</p><h2>Manual of Freediving: Underwater on a Single Breath</h2><p>Is the first comprehensive manual that teaches how to hold the breath, stay underwater longer, and descend deeper into the blue. The book includes a history of freediving, and detailed drawings of underwater exercises, finning techniques and selected Yoga postures to enhance lung capacity. This book is highly recommended to Skin-divers, Scuba-Divers and Surfers. It teaches how to hold the breath longer under water.</p><p>This is the English version of the training manual at Umberto Pelizzari&#39;s Apnea Academy Academy (school of freediving) it is grounded on techniques and teachings inherited from Enzo Maiorca and the late great Jacques Mayol and perfected by Pelizzari and co-author Stefano Tovaglieri. This is the definitive guide, illustrated and up to date, for the aspiring apneist. From theory to practice this manual will accompany the reader in the discovery of a fascinating sport.

The very process of building sections of ships elsewhere and then assembling those parts at the shipyard meant that their very valuable slipways were put to the most economic use and not rendered unusable for launching for months on end whilst a single ship was built from scratch.

Also discusses in depth some key minerals, and explains how to preform simple experiments at home or in the classroom that demonstrate the underlying principles of fluorescence. Includes 12 pages of color plates. Available from Geoscience Press, Inc., 12629 N. Tatum Blvd., Suite 201, Phoenix, AZ 85032. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Fluorescence, the generation of visible light in color via stimulation of ultraviolet radiation, is widely appreciated in mineral museum displays. Robbins's highly readable treatise for mineral collectors and mineralogists begins with an explanation of the terms and dimensions of mineral luminescence and with an overview of activators, the trace elements responsible for inducing fluorescence in minerals. Principal chapters cover gemstones and specific mineral species and their fluorescent colors, activators, and source localities. A major section of the book provides an extensive catalog and description of the fluorescent minerals and their collecting localities. A final chapter concerns a group of interesting laboratory experiments with the nature of light, mineral fluorescence, and crystals. Color plates include 48 excellent photographs of minerals under ultraviolet light. There is a complete bibliography on mineral fluorescence and an index of minerals and localities. The book is well suited to undergraduate geoscience students and to mineral collectors among the general readership, and it is more thorough than Robbins's earlier The collector's Book of Fluorescent Minerals.... -- <i>Choice, September, 1994</i><br><br>Suitable for mineral collectors, gemologists, lapidaries, and inspired amateurs, this book describes how and where to find fluorescent specimens. it details the properties of known fluorescent minerals, including the entire spectrum of colors. -- <i>Geotimes, September 1995</i></p><h2>Naked Fashion Girls: truly beautiful &amp; sexy (English, German, French, Italian and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>�&#x20ac;&#x17e;A snap shot is the truest form of photography.�&#x20ac;&#x153;<br><br>Mike Dowson's photography is simply a case of capturing the moment. He distances himself from any kind of staging and stylisation. This has given him a style again �&#x20ac;&#x201c; perhaps unintended �&#x20ac;&#x201c; the style of "laissez faire". His photographs of pretty girls appear fresh, unconsumed, spontaneous, tasteful and very erotic. Dowson's models must always convey the feeling of availability, the petty bourgeois may call them tarts. However, these girls are no such thing, they are just young, being themselves and showing their lust for life. Mike Dowson thinks that women who display their sexual presence openly are much more erotic than those who come over as aloof and distant. His photography is the same �&#x20ac;&#x201c; simply open and thus more erotic.</p><p>Mike Dowson, born and raised in Manchester / Great Britain, left home at sixteen and moved to Paris.

Le Guin (a Hainish tale), and Kate Wilhelm's alien castaway. Not to forget such almost-as-famous contributors as: Bruce Sterling (religious-cultural clashes), Terry Bisson (the hilarious ``Bears Discover Fire''), Lucius Shepard and Robert Frazier (a chiller), Nancy Kress (disease colonies), Connie Willis (a comic modern El Dorado), Lewis Shiner (a what-if involving Nikola Tesla), and Pat Murphy (robot sex).

Two decades later, it's being rereleased in conjunction with a film version produced by DreamWorks. In the space of five years, Frank Abagnale passed $2.5 million in fraudulent checks in every state and 26 foreign countries. He did it by pioneering implausible and brazen scams, such as impersonating a Pan Am pilot (puddle jumping around the world in the cockpit, even taking over the controls). He also played the role of a pediatrician and faked his way into the position of temporary resident supervisor at a hospital in Georgia. Posing as a lawyer, he conned his way into a position in a state attorney general's office, and he taught a semester of college-level sociology with a purloined degree from Columbia University. <p> The kicker is, he was actually a teenage high school dropout. Now an authority on counterfeiting and secure documents, Abagnale tells of his years of impersonations, swindles, and felonies with humor and the kind of confidence that enabled him to pull off his poseur performances. "Modesty is not one of my virtues. At the time, virtue was not one of my virtues," he writes. In fact, he did it all for his overactive libido--he needed money and status to woo the girls. He also loved a challenge and the ego boost that came with playing important men. What's not disclosed in this highly engaging tale is that Abagnale was released from prison after five years on the condition that he help the government write fraud-prevention programs. So, if you're planning to pick up some tips from this highly detailed manifesto on paperhanging, be warned: this master has already foiled you. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>Frank W.

Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten.

Why, then, did the Roman Catholic Church feel obliged to almost entirely erase this female figure and her role? Was it because of a now proven anti-feminism that existed at the heart of the Church from the early Middle Ages? The Christian conception of femininity, which has certainly greatly evolved in the modern world, especially since the council of Vatican II, is due both to Greco-Roman legacy and to the Hebraic options. With the exception of the female characters of Genesis, who are gripping figures to say the least, the scribes of the Bible lowered the status of Woman by making her impure and thus not apt, for example, to play a sacerdotal role. The idea that Mary Magdalene enjoyed total equality with the apostles has never crossed the minds of Church theologians. Because priests are the legitimate heirs of the apostles, such a standing would make Mary Magdalene, on the one hand, a priestess--how horrible!--and on the other, one of those on whom the apostolic sacerdotal filiation was founded. <br> <br>Yet, when Mary of Bethany washes Jesus&#x2019; feet and anoints him with precious perfume, which Judas, the group&#x2019;s treasurer, believes could be put to a more profitable use, she and Jesus are enacting a kind of sacerdotal and royal ordination--with Mary serving as the priestess who performs the ritual. <br> <br>Is it forbidden to think that Mary of Bethany, over the course of those long moments spent at the feet of the Lord, could have heard what he had to say or at least sensed the full scope of Christ&#x2019;s mystery even if she did not grasp it in its entirety? Jesus persistently tried to lead his disciples to realize this--if only in the &#x98ec;at of the Transfiguration!--but their hearts remained curiously closed all the way to the end. Mary, however, did perceive and accept it. On that day she knew the moment had come to manifest this mystery in chiaroscuro. In a kind of prophetic intuition . . . Mary anointed the head of Jesus, recognizing and presenting him as King and Priest, and anointed his feet as Messiah sent from God. <br> <br>Such a presentation obviously involves a rite of enthronement that can be performed only by a person vested symbolically with sacerdotal powers. Jesus was fully aware of this when he answered Martha&#x2019;s reproaches by saying that Mary &#x201c;had the best part.&#x201d; <br> <br>At that time there were two sites named Bethany: a town two miles east of Jerusalem, where Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived; and on the left bank of the Jordan, at a ford just before the Dead Sea, where John the Baptist baptized. In addition, there was a place called Bethabara, &#x201c;house of passage,&#x201d; by the gates to the desert. John the Baptist and later Mary, each in their own way, granted baptism, initiation, the right of passage, or the means of crossing the threshold. The two Bethanys, then, seem to mirror each other. Magdalene extends the echo of her precursor, John the Baptist. One is a man clad in hides and the other is a woman clad in her long mane of hair. The chief difference between them is that John remains in a harsh and terrible place, screaming in Essenian rigor his curses and his calls to repent, whereas Mary in Bethany, on the opposite where all is blooming and gay, speaks of love and forgiveness and the transition from one world to the next. While Jesus received from John a baptism in water, he did not receive, as the ancient kings had, a consecrating anointing with oil. Just before his Passion and &#x201c;baptism by spirit and fire&#x201d;--the crucifixion--he received the perfumed oil from the female Magdalene. The old and ancient notion of the priest-king applies to Jesus, but this royal unction, let me repeat, can only be performed by a priest--or priestess. <br> <br>The unction in Bethany is surely one of the most important events in the life of Jesus. Furthermore, this is what Jesus himself says to his disciples who are always more or less hostile toward the whims of Woman: He declares to them that this woman truly did &#x201c;what she had to do,&#x201d; and even adds, according to Mark 14:9, &#x201c;In truth, I declare to you, everywhere the Gospel is to be spread, throughout the whole world, one will also recount, in memory of her, the deed she has done.&#x201d; This is acknowledgment of an uncommon power possessed by Mary that went far beyond a mere gesture of female vanity, which is clearly what the first disciples thought it to be, and underscores the importance Magdalene was given in the very words of Jesus. <br> <br>Why, then, was Mary Magdalene relegated to such a minor role in the evangelical tradition as revised and corrected by the Church Fathers? Is the Christian sacerdotal class ashamed to owe so much to a woman? <br> <br>And I cannot forbear from asking myself: what has the memory of the Church done to these words of Jesus? Isn&#x2019;t there something yet to be explored there? And wouldn&#x2019;t this something be the consecration of a specifically female ministry of a prophetic and charismatic nature that Jesus would himself have recognized and proclaimed as existing in tandem with the apostolic and sacerdotal ministry? What a unique place woman would hold in the very heart of the Church if this was the case! <br> <br>The question certainly has been raised--and it seems that Abbe Sauni&#x8ca5; may have answered it in his own way in the church of Rennes-le-Chateau.</p><h2>Voyager</h2><p>The two fliers who made it happen tell their own stories of the designing and building of the Voyager, and the first circumnavigation of the world without refuelling. 16 color and 48 black-and-white photographs.</p><p>On the morning of December 23, 1986, Yeager and Rutan, man and wife, set down their one-of-a-kind, home-built airplane, Voyager, at the base in California where, little more than nine days earlier, they had begun their nonstop flight around the worlda 25,000-mile-plus adventure they describe in dramatically human terms in this richly illustrated book. They tell their story in alternating and nicely dovetailed this-is-how-it-was first-person pieces, with help from Phil Patton, who wrote Open Road and Razzle Dazzle. More than half the book focuses on the several years before the flight, which Jeana and Dick, with a growing legion of professional and volunteer helpers, spent designing, building, testing and testing again (dangerously) their ultra-light, catamaran-shaped craft with its tiny "horizontal telephone booth" cockpit. The intrepid pair, who "didn't know what we were getting ourselves into," met at an airshow, he a Vietnam flier of 105 missions, she both a pilot and a horse-trainer. They shared the dream of the flight, fell in love, married and went on to see their know-how and courage tested almost beyond endurance in the voyage that more than once nearly ended in disaster.

The demanding physical requirements of the flight and the setbacks in its preparation represent a pinnacle of endurance by Yeager and Rutan, who spent six years designing, building, and testing the aircraft. Voyager 's uniqueness was in its airfoil design, immense fuel capacity, and very light composite structure.

Suppose, too, that while 'long separated from the world' you had acquired a reputation for conduct utterly unacceptable in civilised society. Many would reckon you a scoundrel and liar, despite your protests. Lively reminiscences - such as saving the city of Lahore in 1841 by singlehandedly killing 300 invaders - and numerous scars would not impress them. Gardner's story, like Marco Polo's, changed people's understanding of the world. The urge to contest or authenticate his account contributed to the scientific and political penetration of a vast chunk of Asia. Readers will see the whole region, from the Caspian to Tibet, in a new light and gain a fresh perspective on its last years under native rule. Keay&#x2019;s credentials for writing the biography of Gardner are unrivalled.</p><p>John Keay&#39;s narrative histories of India, China and the East India Company are widely regarded as standard works. His India: A History has sold over 200,000 copies and the &#39;EIC&#39; book has been in print for over 25 years. He is also the author of the Royal Geographical Society&#39;s History of World Exploration. As a fellow of the Royal Literary Fund, his prose is rated &#39;exquisite&#39; (Observer). For his literary contribution to Asian studies he was awarded the Royal Asiatic Society&#39;s Sykes Medal in 2009. Gardner first featured in Keay&#39;s The Explorers of the Western Himalaya, which the Irish Times described as &#39;a book to be bought, treasured and never ever lent&#39;."Keay&#x2019;s Tartan Turban is replete with adventure, drama, tragedy &amp; mystery... The smooth, elegant prose, easy and natural, confirms the author&#x2019;s reputation as a storyteller of brilliance. The weave between factual discussion and narrative is almost invisible, the pace is solid and adept... This then is a story that is worthy of motion picture treatment. Few lives could have been so heroically flawed and so madly eccentric or so deserving of notice, but at the same time it was a life played in a sort of gaudy, inglorious, undertone, because Gardiner never stepped fully into the limelight in his own lifetime. Happily we now have John Keay&#x2019;s book to bring this fascinating character back into focus."

As women living in the seventeenth century, Glikl bas Judah Leib, Marie de l'Incarnation, and Maria Sibylla Merian, equally remarkable though very different, were not queens or noblewomen, their every move publicly noted. Rather, they were living "on the margins" in seventeenth-century Europe, North America, and South America. Yet these women--one Jewish, one Catholic, one Protestant--left behind memoirs and writings that make for a spellbinding tale and that, in Davis' deft narrative, tell us more about the life of early modern Europe than many an official history. </p><p> All these women were originally city folk. Glikl bas Judah Leib was a merchant of Hamburg and Metz whose Yiddish autobiography blends folktales with anecdotes about her two marriages, her twelve children, and her business. Marie de l'Incarnation, widowed young, became a mystic visionary among the Ursuline sisters and cofounder of the first Christian school for Amerindian women in North America. Her letters are a rich source of information about the Huron, Algonquin, Montagnais, and Iroquois peoples of Quebec. Maria Sibylla Merian, a German painter and naturalist, produced an innovative work on tropical insects based on lore she gathered from the Carib, Arawak, and African women of Suriname. Along the way she abandoned her husband to join a radical Protestant sect in the Netherlands. Drawing on Glikl's memoirs, Marie's autobiography and correspondence, and Maria's writings on entomology and botany, Davis brings these women to vibrant life. She reconstructs the divergent paths their stories took, and at the same time shows us each amid the common challenges and influences of the time--childrearing, religion, an outpouring of vernacular literature--and in relation to men. </p><p> The resulting triptych suggests the range of experience, self-consciousness, and expression possible in seventeenth-century Europe and its outposts. It also shows how persons removed from the centers of power and learning ventured in novel directions, modifying in their own way Europe's troubled and ambivalent relations with other "marginal" peoples. </p></p><p><b>Natalie Zemon Davis</b> is Henry Charles Lea Professor of History, Emerita, Princeton University.[This] stylishly sketched seventeenth- and eighteenth-century biographical triptych is yet another exploration of how the modest in early modern Europe strove to fashion identities for themselves, but it is also more. (Arthur Quinn <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>A treasure. Davis has written a scholarly...and multilayered history...Her three subjects come alive. (Ruth Johnstone Wales <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>)<br><br>Davis's work has always reached beyond fashionable trends to communicate with a wider audience. Where feminist historians have often inveighed against writing women's history in order to supply us with heroines, Davis gives us three rounded portraits of strong early modern women with whom we are certainly encouraged to identify, and whose dilemmas are not unlike our own. Where early modern historians insist on the ubiquity of patriarchy, Davis presents us with hard-working, bread-winning women, never submerged in motherhood and never obliterated as wives...All that Davis writes springs from careful, critical consideration of the mass of theoretical writing that has recently appeared on women's writing and historical anthropology: none of it clutters her text...For Davis, the historian is a teller of stories. Her book can be read as a way of writing history which does not collar the reader with direct argument or interpretation, but which seeks instead to provoke the imagination. Davis begins with a fictitious dialogue between herself and the three women whose lives she has chronicled, an imaginative risk few scholars would care to take. This is the sort of book that lingers in the mind. In time, one realizes that what Natalie Zemon Davis has accomplished is a new way of thinking about the relations between the Old World and the New, between women and men, mothers and children; and a vast opening up of the territory of the historian.

(Lorna Sage <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>In an extraordinary work of scholarship, Natalie Zemon Davis...has brought together within the pages of one book three 17th-century European women who lived lives of daring and accomplishment on 'the margins.' Davis sets out to demonstrate that, in their work far from the centres of power, Glikl bas Judah Leib, Marie de l'Incarnation, and Sibylla Merian were not only breaking new ground for women, but that in doing so they were in some ways morally superior to the men of their day. (Katherine Govier <i>Toronto Star</i>)<br><br>One of the most inspired historians of early modern France has pushed out the usual borders of female blazons by choosing three women who weren't muses, mistresses or martyrs...Davis has chosen three personalities of singular gifts and appetite for self-transformation, and the strength of character to achieve it.

(Robin Blake <i>Independent on Sunday</i>)<br><br>Through intimate studies of three seventeenth-century women, [Natalie Zemon Davis] reconstructs histories that both fill out the conceptual frameworks of early modern women's history, and challenge them...One of the great values of Davis's work is the precision with which it tracks its subjects through the multiple domains of their lives: from convent to new frontier, from home to marketplace, from the field to the drawing board...Their lives, as reconstructed through Davis's meticulous and compelling narrative, also shed light on a whole range of social, spiritual and cultural worlds for women, marginalized from much historical narrative...It ends by unsettling the most obvious frameworks for early modern women's history--the household, the workshop, the church--and by demanding historical space for the explorations, the reflections, and the ordinary physical experiences of its subjects.

Over the centuries, temple builders have relied on magic numbers to shape sacred spaces, astronomers have used geometry to calculate holy seasons, and philosophers have observed the harmony of the universe in the numerical properties of music. By showing how the discoveries of mathematics are manifested over and over again in biology and physics, and how they have inspired the greatest works of art, this illuminating study reveals the universal principles that link us to the infinite.</p><p>Stephen Skinner is a renowned author. He has published over 20 books, which have been translated into more than 16 languages, on subjects such as sacred geometry, geomancy and divination, feng shui and prophecy. Location: UK.Skinner, credited with introducing feng shui to the West, continues his search for the underlying order of the world with this beautifully illustrated examination of the notion that some geometries reveal hidden truths about the way the universe operates. Beginning with the Greeks, such as Euclid and Pythagoras, who, Skinner explains, invented geometry as a means of constructing sacred buildings in a way that was pleasing to the gods, the text explores a variety of natural and human-made examples of sacred geometry, including the construction of Stonehenge, the shapes of crystals, and the idea of "living spirals" (the horn of a goat, the shell of a nautilus, or DNA). While some parts of the book are harder to accept than others--see, for example, the discussion of crop circles--Skinner argues persuasively that many aspects of art, architecture, and science are linked through mathematics to universal principles that govern the universe. The book's success depends entirely on how much stock one puts in this basic premise, but Skinner makes a remarkably elegant case. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This was the deeply held conviction of Thomas Brooks, the author of this book. As a pastor who knew his people well, he feared that many Christians do not understand the necessity, excellency, and usefulness of private prayer, and that many live too great a neglect of this indispensable duty. Focusing on our Lord&#39;s words about closet-prayer in Matthew 6:6, Brooks gives us a masterful treatment of a vitally important aspect of Christian s living. His aim is intensely practical, to preserve and keep up the power of religion and godliness both in men&#39;s houses, hearts, and lives.</p><p>Little is known about Thomas Brooks as a man, other than can be ascertained from his many writings. Born, probably of well-to-do parents, in 1608, Brooks entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1625. He was licensed as a preacher of the gospel by 1640 at the latest. Before that date he seems to have spent a number of years at sea, probably as a chaplain with the fleet. After the Civil War, Brooks became minister at Thomas Apostle s, London, and was sufficiently renowned to be chosen as preacher before the House of Commons on 26 December, 1648. Three or four years later he moved to St Margaret s, Fish-street Hill, London, but encountered considerable opposition as he refused baptism and the Lord s Supper to those clearly unworthy of such privileges. The following years were filled with written as well as spoken ministry. In 1662 he fell victim to the notorious Act of Uniformity, but he appears to have remained in his parish and to have preached the Word as opportunity offered. Treatises continued to flow from his agile pen. In 1677 or 1678 he married for the second time, she spring-young, he winter-old . Two years later he went home to his Lord.</p><h2>Lost Shepherd: How Pope Francis is Misleading His Flock</h2><p>Faithful Catholics are beginning to realize it&#x2019;s not their imagination.

But she returns to find trouble brewing and tongues wagging at fever pitch. The local old-folks' home has been sold to a mysterious outsider, and overnight the place has been transformed into the Stonebridge Foundation, an exclusive rehabilitation center complete with a stone-faced guard who doesn't speak a word of English and an even nastier dog. Soon there are rumors flying of mental patients roaming the countryside at night, and every character in town is keeping a gun close at hand, just in case. Everyone is dying to know what goes on behind those inhospitable gates, with the exception of Arly, who has enough rural business to keep her satisfied. <p> When the beautiful young receptionist found drowned in the garden pool is identified as a local girl from nearby Farberville, it's clear the case may not only involve the suspicious characters who've recently moved to town, but also some of the citizens of Maggody, who may have a secret or two to hide themselves. There's the doctor who can't resist a dose of his own medicine and a roster of patients that reads like a who's who of tabloid headlines, as well as the local pastor who gets his spiritual inspiration with a little help from the sacramental wine, and the mayor's wife who makes it her business to know everything about everyone. Soon Arly finds herself on the trail of a killer and discovers she may be the "only" innocent person left in town. </p><p></p></p><p><b>Joan Hess</b> is the author of the critically acclaimed Maggody mysteries, including the Pocket Books paperbacks <i>Muletrain to Maggody, Maggody and the Moonbeams, Misery Loves Maggody,</i> and <i>murder@maggody.com,</i> nominated for the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.

Joan Hess lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas.The prolific Hess, author of 15 Claire Malloy mysteries, now delivers the fifteenth in her Arly Hanks series. Although both series are set in small-town Arkansas, the protagonists are very different women--Claire is a lovable bumbler whereas Arly delights readers with her brains and smart mouth. In this adventure, Arly returns from a camping trip to find the tiny town of Maggody (population 755) abuzz. The local home for the elderly has been sold to an unknown buyer, who kicks out the residents and transforms the space into the mysterious Stonebridge Foundation. When the Stonebridge receptionist is found drowned, the activities surrounding the place take on a sinister air. Throughout it all, Arly struggles to keep her aplomb, especially when some Maggody citizens start to look a little suspicious. Her mother, Ruby Bee, and Ruby's best friend, Estelle, add a generous dash of humor to the proceedings, as do other zany characters of the tiny town. Good, clean fun that will please fans of Hess' madcap mix of comedy and mystery. <i>Jenny McLarin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Budziszewski&#x2019;s newest book is about the lost world of common truths&#x2014;what we all really know about right and wrong. <p>We are passing through an eerie phase of history. The things that everyone really knows are treated as unheard of, and the principles of decency are attacked as indecent. Exposing the emptiness of contemporary moral fashions, Budziszewski explores the rules of human conduct that we can&#x2019;t not know. </p><p>Budziszewski&#x2019;s purpose is to "bolster the confidence of plain people in the rational foundations of their common moral sense." He shows that certain moral truths&#x2014;"as real as arithmetic"&#x2014;are part of the equipment of a rational mind. They are not only true for all, but at some level known to all. Yet, paradoxically, they are under attack. He explains why. </p><p>Addressing "the persuaded, the half-persuaded, and the wish-I-were-persuaded," Budziszewski shows the unanimity of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish traditions about these common truths. But what about the unpersuaded&#x2014;those who deny the reality of the moral law, who are on the other side of the great dispute over the basic norms for human life? Civility, he insists, does not require that this unprecedented gulf be papered over. What&#x2019;s needed are charity and clarity, which he provides in abundance. </p><p>"A few times in a generation, if we are fortunate, moral intelligence finds a voice as lucid, engaging, and relentless as that of J. Budziszewski," says Richard John Neuhaus, publisher of First Things.</p></p><p>This book is about the lost world of common moral truths -- what we all really know about right and wrong. I hope to achieve two things. The first is to bolster the confidence of plain people in the rational foundations of their common moral sense. This requires not only explaining what these foundations are, but also explaining why this common sense is under attack -- especially explaining how it is even possible for what we all really know to be denied, and why this doesn't mean that isn't really known. The second goal is to present the explanation in such a way that all of the people who think and write about the common truths can achieve a firmer alliance in their defense. This is necessary because the traditions which do affirm the common truths speak in such different ways that the unanimity of their affirmation is obscured. <p>My goal is less to present my own theory (though of course I have one) than to defend the universal moral inheritance of the human race. Because many are hostile to this universal inheritance, I expect to hit a few nerves. That may make it a bit harder than usual to know whether the more hysterical sort of reviewer is reacting to what I've actually said, or merely expressing fury against things like the Ten Commandments. For this reason, I encourage potential readers to read Amazon's samples from the book and decide for themselves what they think. Happy reading!</p>We are passing through an eerie phase of history in which the things that everyone really knows are treated as unheard of, a time in which the elements of common decency are themselves attacked as indecent.

Growing up on the high Yellowstone Plateau on the state's oldest dude ranch, a family business dating back to 1898, Spragg wrangles horses for his taciturn father, trying to win his respect and approval. At age fourteen, Spragg shoots and mercy-kills his beloved, aged, sickly steed, whose corpse will be used as bait for bears targeted by human hunters.

It's an enthralling read, hilarious and heartbreaking by turns, populated by characters who seem, on first glimpse, to be wilfully eccentric, but emerge as realistic and grounded, taking what control they can of their lives. . . . <i>Sweetland</i> is a thing of beauty, one of the finest novels we are likely to encounter this year. It demonstrates, as the best fiction does (and as Crummey's novels always have) that the past is always with us, and that contemporary events are history embodied and in motion." --<i>Vancouver Sun&nbsp;</i><br><br></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For twelve generations, when the fish were plentiful and when they all-but disappeared, the inhabitants of this remote island in Newfoundland have lived and died together. Now, in the second decade of the 21st century, they are facing resettlement, and each has been offered a generous compensation package to leave. But the money is offered with a proviso: everyone has to go; the government won't be responsible for one crazy coot who chooses to stay alone on an island.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That coot is Moses Sweetland. Motivated in part by a sense of history and belonging, haunted by memories of the short and lonely time he spent away from his home as a younger man, and concerned that his somewhat eccentric great-nephew will wilt on the mainland, Moses refuses to leave. But in the face of determined, sometimes violent, opposition from his family and his friends, Sweetland is eventually swayed to sign on to the government's plan. Then a tragic accident prompts him to fake his own death and stay on the deserted island. As he manages a desperately diminishing food supply, and battles against the ravages of weather, Sweetland finds himself in the company of the vibrant ghosts of the former islanders, whose porch lights still seem to turn on at night.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, January 2015:</strong> There&#x2019;s a quietness to Michael Crummey&#x2019;s novel that adds to its power. <i>Sweetland</i> is about a man, Moses Sweetland, who lives on an island off of Newfoundland. The island itself is called Sweetland, named by Moses Sweetland&#x2019;s ancestors, and it&#x2019;s a dying place. In fact, the entire population has been offered a lump payment by the government to remove themselves from the island. There are only two holdouts to the deal: the village idiot and the sixty-nine year old Moses Sweetland. What&#x2019;s most appealing about this subtle, entertaining, and quietly moving novel is the humanity of its characters and the genuine feel of Sweetland itself. Each character is real and truly imagined; it&#x2019;s the kind of book and the kind of place where many readers will just want to linger. Communities like Sweetland, with their specific ways of talking and being, are growing less common. Crummey&#x2019;s book is a testament to those places and the people who live there. <i>--Chris Schluep</i></p><p>MICHAEL CRUMMEY is the author of a memoir, <i>Newfoundland: Journey into a Lost Nation</i>, three books of poetry including <i>Arguments with Gravity</i>, winner of the Writers' Alliance of Newfoundland and Labrador Book Award for Poetry, and a book of short stories <i>Flesh &amp; Blood</i>.

Miner discusses the multiple roles that Aztl�n has played at various moments in time, from the pre-Cuauhtemoc codices through both Spanish and American colonial regimes, past the Chicano Movement and into the present day. Across this &#x201c;migration story,&#x201d; Miner challenges notions of mestizaje and asserts Aztl�n, as visualized by Xicano artists, as a form of Indigenous sovereignty.<br><br> Throughout this book, Miner employs Indigenous and Native American methodologies to show that Chicano art needs to be understood in the context of Indigenous history, anticolonial struggle, and Native American studies. Miner pays particular attention to art outside the U.S. Southwest and includes discussions of work by Nora Chapa Mendoza, Gilbert "Mag�" Luj�n, Santa Barraza, Malaqu�as Montoya, Carlos Cort�z Koyokuikatl, Favianna Rodr�guez, and Dignidad Rebelde, which includes Melanie Cervantes and Jes�s Barraza.<br> With sixteen pages of color images, this book will be crucial to those interested in art history, anthropology, philosophy, and Chicano and Native American studies. <i>Creating Aztl�n </i>interrogates the historic and important role that Aztl�n plays in Chicano and Indigenous art and culture.</p><p>Dylan A.

That premise certainly doesn't hold true for this enjoyable publication. Its scope is broad, for it includes information not only on the history of books but also on the evolution of the printing industry, libraries, medieval illumination and modern illustration, the book trade (including book fairs and bookstores), problems with bookworms (genus Anobium , not avid readers), and methods of conservation. The illustrations, most of which are in color, are taken from such sources as Pompeian walls, papyrus scrolls, medieval parchment and vellum manuscripts, woodcuts, frescoes, and panel paintings. If the author errs, it is in trying to present too much information and in sometimes failing to define terms adequately. Nonetheless, this is a fine addition to any library and should appeal especially to book collectors, librarians, and--because of its many illustrations--art historians and picture researchers.<br><i>- Margarete Gross, Chicago P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Psychohistorical Crisis</h2><p><br>A loving homage to Asimov, and dialogue with him--a triumph of galactic-scaled SF that is destined to be recognized as a classic in its own right<br><br>Eron Osa had faced the ultimate penalty. Not death, but the removal of his fam. Without the augmentation of his brain by his electronic familiar, he can barely function amidst the bewildering complexities of everyday life on Splendid Wisdom. Here, on the capital world of the galaxy's Second Empire, everyone from the meanest citizen to the ruling Pscholars has depended upon a fam since childhood. Without one, simply navigating the streets and levels of the planetary megalopolis is a paralyzing challenge.

If only he could remember what it was!<br><br></p><p>Donald Kingsbury is a retired professor of mathematics at McGill University.Admirers of Isaac Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, possibly the greatest SF series ever, will be drawn to this oddly titled sequel from the author of the Hugo-nominated Courtship Rite (1982), but they shouldn't get their hopes too high. No one, including Asimov himself in his belated efforts to further milk his cash cow, has succeeded in capturing the breadth, excitement and imaginative scope of the original. Canadian Kingsbury, too, falls short. Nearly as long as the entire Asimov trilogy, this continuation suffers from long-windedness and a surfeit of italics. The author, though, does create a convincing and fresh simulacrum of the world of the 761st century. For a crime he can't remember, Eron Osa, a 30-year-old psychohistorian, must give up his fam, that is, his personal familiar, a device plugged into his brain that immeasurably enhances all aspects of his life, particularly his power to absorb and resolve problems. Members of the Second Galactic Empire populate the Milky Way galaxy of a million worlds, in which the only "aliens" are genetically engineered talking dogs. Some people, not much different from today's humans, behave admirably, while others are addicted to power and war. Women play only peripheral roles in a male-dominated universe. For all its ambitions, this work lacks the great storytelling qualities of Asimov's trilogy and captures only some of its ambience.

It's appropriate, then, that he should choose to explore one of the most defining moments in American music: Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes. <br><br>It was 1967--the Summer of Love. Bob Dylan and five other musicians (later known as The Band) met in a bungalow in Woodstock, New York, and wrote and produced music that ignored the psychedelic sounds of the time, songs that would eventually become known simply as "The Basement Tapes." The group mined the history of American music and their own talents to produce legendary tracks that were bootleg issues before appearing in official release. <br><br>That is the alchemy that was practiced in the Basement Tapes laboratory, and "in that alchemy," Marcus writes, "is an undiscovered country, like the purloined letter hiding in plain sight." Marcus explores this music and the cauldron of the American experience in which it was formed in a book that illuminates America, then and now.<br></p><p>While focusing on a select group of musicians performing privately in a brief window of time, noted music and culture writer Greil Marcus cuts to the core of the American musical legacy to study it as a slightly blurred snapshot, full of shadow and mystery. <i>Invisible Republic: Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes</i> centers around the now legendary recordings made by Bob Dylan and The Band in 1967, and how this music signaled a change in American music by capturing the essence of the moment within the context of a rich folk tradition. During these casual sessions they recorded more than 100 songs, some originals, but most borrowed from barely remembered folk, blues, and country musicians. <p> This music they derived from had been part of the American fabric in an anonymous way that can only be explained as folklore and myth, and they breathed new life into it while adhering to its legacy. Though never intended for release, these recordings molded into the tradition of music as oral history, and appropriately, a few tapes were passed hand to hand, then some were pressed as bootleg records, which then spread like rumors. This folk revival conjured up a collection of timeless stories that many had heard in a slightly different form without ever knowing who started them. Just as Dylan did with the <i>Basement Tapes,</i> Marcus's exhilarating book extends beyond music and into the psyche of America, making the present more clear by putting the past into focus.</p>Greil Marcus wrote the liner notes for The Basement Tapes in 1975 and is the author of Mystery Train: Images of America in Rock 'n' Roll Music and Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century.

From these bitter facts, Beverly Lowry--the first child's mother and an acclaimed novelist--has fashioned a memoir in which the objectivity of true-crime reportage resonates with acute feeling and even, ultimately, with redemption.<br><br>In Houston, in the early morning hours of June 13, 1983, twenty-three-year-old Karla Faye Tucker showed up with two friends at the apartment of a man they hated, Jerry Lynn Dean. Fired by a lost weekend of drugs and bravado, during which their grievances against Jerry Lynn became magnified out of all proportion, they had it in mind to steal motorcycle parts. Maybe to scare him a little. But by the time they left, both Dean and his chance, one-night companion had been murdered with such thorough wickedness as to ensure Karla's place among the handful of young white women on Death Row in this country.<br><br>The next fall, outside of Austin, Beverly Lowry's son Peter, after an increasingly troubled adolescence, was back in high school and back living at home when he was killed--an unsolved hit-and-run. He was eighteen. The despair that descended into Lowry's life seemed without end, but eventually and almost inevitably she became obsessed by the beautiful young killer whose photograph she'd seen in a Houston newspaper. "If Peter hadn't been killed," she writes, "I would not have made that first trip up to see Karla Faye."<br><br>In <i>Crossed Over,</i> Beverly Lowry reveals how Tucker, a full-time addict and part-time prostitute, had been dealt this fate as a child--only to pursue it relentlessly herself in Houston's violent subculture of bikers and outlaws. Working backward from the murders, Lowry delves into character and motive, looking for reasons that might explain these unthinkable acts. But this is also an account of the unlikely and powerful friendship between a writer--a <i>mother</i>--coming to terms with her loss and a young woman who, even under the sentence of death, begins the life she'd never before had a chance to lead.<br><br><i>Crossed Over</i> is a story of crime and punishment, but more importantly it explores the connection between grief and hope, and between different kinds of victims. In the end, what Beverly Lowry uncovers is the unexpected ability of life, however blighted the circumstances, to assert its best, most urgent claim upon us.</p><p>"When the four great waves that inundated the former republic of Texas subsided--cattle, oil, evangelical Christianity, and narcotics--among the things left standing was a pretty, young pickax murderess named Karla Faye Tucker, the subject of this brilliant book. Out of her own imperiled but unflinching spirit, Beverly Lowry has produced a riveting work, visceral and elegant, which finds humanity where its existence is denied. To read this book is to be swept away."<br>--Thomas McGuane<br><br>"Crossed Over is a moving, engrossing, daring book. Beverly Lowry has taken some large themes--grief, guilt, and attachment--and dealt with them compellingly."<br>--Larry McMurtry<br><br>"Not serial-killer chic, not true-crime, Crossed Over is a hard look at (and rejection of) the 'born bad' key to hideously violent behavior. It is elegantly written and painfully experienced."<br>--Andrew Vachss<br><br>"Gripping true-crime details and marvelous local color in Lowry's rendering of the wild, heartless boomtown of Houston make this a real page-turner.

Coming of age as an artist in the 1950s, Alex Katz set out to reinvent representational painting in the wake of Abstract Expressionism. At first, Katz struggled to find an audience, destroying hundreds of canvases. This book surveys the artwork that survived from this momentous decade, one in which he first painted outdoors, innovated with collages, and met Ada del Moro, his wife and muse. The essays in this book contextualize Katz&#x2019;s painting, consider how he and his peers looked at one another, mined 19th-century portraiture, and borrowed from television, advertising, and cinema. The result is a fascinating study of a young artist laying the groundwork for an astonishingly successful career. Fans of Katz will be inspired by the radicality of his early work, and those being introduced to the artist will be struck by its freshness and relevance.</p><p>Diana Tuite is the Katz Curator at the Colby Museum of Art.<br><br>Sharon Corwin is Carolyn Muzzy Director and Chief Curator at the Colby Museum of<br><br>Art.<br><br>Katy Siegel is Professor of Art History at Hunter College where she is Chief Curator of the College Galleries.

Her previous collection, Otherwise: New &amp; Selected Poems, published just after her death in 1995, has been a favorite among readers, with over 60,000 copies in print, and is a contemporary classic.</p><p>Now at the ten-year anniversary of her death, Kenyon's Collected Poems assembles all of her published poetry in one book. Included here are the complete poems found in her four previous volumes--<i>From Room to Room</i>, <i>The Boat of Quiet Hours</i>, <i>Let Evening Come</i>, and <i>Constance</i>--as well as the poems that appear in her posthumous volumes <i>Otherwise</i> and <i>A Hundred White Daffodils</i>, four poems never before published in book form, and her translations in <i>Twenty Poems of Anna Akhmatova</i>.</p></p><p><b>Jane Kenyon</b> is the author of <i>Otherwise: New &amp; Selected Poems</i> and A<i> Hundred White Daffodils</i>. She lived with her husband, Donald Hall, in Wilmot, New Hampshire, until her death in 1995.Jane Kenyon's collection Otherwise: New &amp; Selected Poems was published in 1996, less than a year after the poet's death at 47 from leukemia. The poems were selected by the poet during the last days of her life. Her husband, Donald Hall, an institution in American letters himself, wrote poignantly of this process in the afterword of Otherwise and at greater length in his memoir The Best Day The Worst Day: Life with Jane Kenyon.<p>With 60,000 copies in print, Otherwise has become a phenomenon in American poetry publishing, and Kenyon belongs on a short list of contemporary poets whose work sustains readers who do not usually turn to poetry. It is no wonder her work has inspired genuine affection among so many; Kenyon's poems cultivate a warm, familiar voice that invites the reader into the pains and pleasures of everyday life with an honest and engaging intimacy.</p><p>Now, at the 10-year anniversary of her death, Kenyon's Collected Poems brings all of her published poetry together in one volume. Given the abiding strength and impact of Otherwise, it would be easy to argue against the need for this new book. Not counting Kenyon's translations from Twenty Poems of Anna Akhmatova, only 35 poems have been added to those in Otherwise, and, with just a few exceptions -- "Climb" from the 1993 collection, Constance, and the unfinished poem "Woman, Why Are You Weeping?" are standouts -- the additional poems do not much change our understanding of Kenyon's accomplishments or the direction she might have gone had she lived longer. </p><p>Still, as Otherwise stands as a memorial to the writer's life, Collected Poems is a celebration of the journey the poet took in the development of that life. The new collection follows Kenyon from her first book, From Room to Room, published in 1978, through the last poem she started after her illness had advanced, "The Sick Wife." By reconstructing Kenyon's books in their published versions, Collected Poems provides a complete picture of the poet becoming more confident in her craft and expanding the ambitions of her work.</p><p>Kenyon's struggles with depression throughout her life are well-known, and her work is as important to any understanding of contemporary poetry on this subject as William Styron's Darkness Visible is to prose literature. In "Depression in Winter," she describes a walk through snow as "throwing myself forward with a violence/ of effort, greedy for unhappiness," and in "Evening Sun," a memory of childhood becomes the impetus to re-experience the realization "that I would have to live, and go on/ living: what a sorrow it was; and still/ what sorrow burns/ but does not destroy my heart." The perseverance against the despair Kenyon writes about is an unending battle, and the forthrightness with which she took this up in her poems will continue to resonate with readers. "Having It Out with Melancholy," her most ambitious poem on the subject, calls out this "anti-urge,/ the mutilator of souls," and through the litany of pharmaceuticals, the respite of sleep and the dog -- "Sometimes the sound of his breathing/ saves my life" -- she finds the fleeting peace to celebrate birdsong, "overcome/ by ordinary contentment."</p><p>The mind is not her only subject. Bodily concerns appear in all of Kenyon's books. In the early poem "Cages," the corporeal world takes its shape first in a "dead beagle" and then through "animals in cages," which leads to the question, "And the body, what about the body?" There is no easy answer -- "Sometimes it is my favorite child," "And sometimes my body disgusts me." The speaker can only reach this conclusion:</p><p>Then I have to agree that the body<br>is a cloud before the soul's eye.<br>This long struggle to be at home<br>in the body, this difficult friendship.</p><p>In "Winter Lambs," a friend's unplanned pregnancy leads to this declaration: "We are creation's/ property, its particles, its clay/ as we fall into this life,/ agree or disagree." The physical and metaphysical are inescapable elements that Kenyon returned to often in her work. </p><p>Then there are the heart-rending poems of loss and letting go. With these powerful opening lines, "In the Nursing Home" belongs among the finest lyrics of the last half-century:</p><p>She is like a horse grazing<br>a hill pasture that someone makes<br>smaller by coming every night<br>to pull the fences in and in.</p><p>Again and again, Kenyon confronts the unbearable nature of loss and puts forward her belief that "Searching for God is the first thing and the last,/ but in between such trouble, and such pain."</p><p>Kenyon's introduction to and translations (with Vera Sandomirsky Dunham) of Twenty Poems of Anna Akhmatova may seem an odd way to close Collected Poems, but it is hard to imagine the incantatory beauty of "Let Evening Come" or the stoic lyricism of "August Rain, After Haying" without this influence. And there is something fitting about Collected Poems closing with the words Kenyon chose to end her poem "Lines for Akhmatova": "I can't tell/ if the day is ending, or the world,/ or if the secret of secrets is within me again."</p><p>Otherwise will deservedly continue to bring new readers to Kenyon's work, but if you already find Kenyon a vital and essential poet, buy this Collected Poems and give your copy of Otherwise to someone you care about to help keep Kenyon's spirit alive. </p><p>Reviewed by Jon Tribble <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post.

You just sort of float around while this Altman-esque point of view shifts back and forth between a little ensemble of strange, endeeringly damaged people. Murakami&#39;s narration is what really makes this work so well, the voice he uses is almost mesmerizing at times. The whole thing is just suffused with this jazzy, hypnotic stlye that occasionally veers into something darker, something more primevally resonant. If William Gibson and David Lynch wrote a book together while listening to Kind of Blue, they would probably have come up with something like this. What does happen out there in the world after dark?

Based on extensive interviews with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Jo�o Gilberto, and all the major musicians and their friends, this retrospective&nbsp;is full of passion and betrayal, love and hate, comedy and tragedy.</p><p>Ruy Castro grew up to the sound of bossa nova in Rio. He has been a staff writer, reporter, and editor for over half a dozen major Brazilian magazines and newspapers.For North American audiences, bossa nova was "a brief Brazilian seduction" before the British invasion of the 1960s, when it fell from the world stage into the background, where it continues to appeal. But in Brazil, bossa nova meant an innovative new soundAa "serenely syncretic" take on sambaAto accompany the country's other modernizations. A bestseller in Brazil, Castro's book might lack some context for readers here. But it is an energetic journalistic history with a lively cast of characters, set mostly in the beachside neighborhoods and nightclubs of Rio de Janeiro. Castro outlines the careers of, among others, pioneers Antonio Carlos Jobim and Joao Gilberto. Gilberto has always cut a curious figure: a poetic, idiosyncratic, charming young man, he became in later years a productive, exacting recluse. Enumerating poets, diplomats and critics who wrote music or lyrics, the narrative depicts a music-loving societyAthe wide-reaching R dio Nacional was likely "the largest rhythmical democracy in the world"Athat incubated bossa nova throughout its inceptionAin the music of Frank Sinatra and Stan KentonAand evolution during the composition of Black Orpheus.

No one had any idea what was coming. My parents had four children before me, and I should have been born, plain and simple. On a Friday. But July 21, 1972, came&#x2014;and almost went&#x2014;without much to show for it.<br><br> As midnight neared, however, my mother, Mary Hoge, went into labor. My parents didn&#x2019;t own a telephone, so Mom rushed next door and asked the neighbors to call my father, Vince, home from work. Dad raced back from his job at a factory that made food for chickens. They had no time to spare. It would take them about half an hour to reach the hospital from our suburban Brisbane home.<br><br> My father arrived, jumped out of the car into the dark night and ran upstairs. He packed my mother into the car as fast as he could, and they left for the hospital.<br><br> When Mom was admitted, her contractions that signaled the baby was coming were two minutes apart. Her baby should be there very soon. But at 2 a.m. on Saturday morning the contractions stopped dead. The doctors were worried and told my parents they might have to induce labor if the contractions didn&#x2019;t restart. Mom was sent to the hospital ward to wait. At 5:30 a.m. on Sunday, July 23, her contractions resumed. It was a long, difficult labor for a fifth baby, and I was born at 12:35 p.m.<br><br> Back then, a mother&#x2019;s usual first question would have been: &#x201c;Is it a boy or a girl?&#x201d; But something didn&#x2019;t seem quite right, so my mother had a different question for the doctors.<br><br> &#x201c;Is my baby okay?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br> &#x201c;No, Mrs. Hoge,&#x201d; the doctor said, looking up in shock. &#x201c;He is not okay.

An actor, screenwriter, and former private investigator, Parnell lives in New York City.The Sudoku Puzzle Murders<br><i>Chapter</i> 1Cora Felton gripped the black marker firmly in her right hand and stepped up to the easel in the front of the Bakerhaven, Connecticut, town hall. On the white board was a giant square. Thick, black lines in the shape of a tic-tac-toe divided it into nine smaller squares. Thinner black lines divided each in turn into nine even smaller squares. In some of these squares, numerals from 1 through 9 had been entered, one number per square.A sudoku.In the back of the crowded town hall, Aaron Grant, just in from the airport, stashed his suitcase behind the door, and scanned the rows of seats for Sherry Carter. She had to be there. Cora Felton, the much vaunted Puzzle Lady, who hawked breakfast cereal to children in TV ads, was merely a figurehead, a kindly, grandmotherly face to adorn the nationally syndicated crossword puzzle column. Sherry actually created the puzzles. Cora could neither construct nor solve a crossword puzzle if her life depended on it. Only a handful of people knew the secret. Cora was always running the risk of being exposed as a fake. Without Sherry, she was lost.But Cora&#x2019;s niece wasn&#x2019;t there.Becky Baldwin, easily Bakerhaven&#x2019;s attorney most likely to be mistaken for a Gap dancer, waved him over.&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Sherry?&#x201d; Aaron whispered, sliding into a seat next to her.She shrugged. Becky used to date Aaron, and still bristled at the name of her rival.&#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t here?&#x201d;&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen her.&#x201d;&#x201c;Strange,&#x201d; Aaron said. He wondered how Cora was going to get through. The Puzzle Lady&#x2019;s presentations were usually like a marionette act, with Sherry pulling the strings.Cora glanced at the board, then back at her audience. &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, for the two percent of you who have never seen one of these, this is a sudoku. For the ten percent of you who don&#x2019;t know how to solve one, I&#x2019;m going to show you.&#x201d;Cora turned to the puzzle. She knew exactly how to explain it, because Sherry had drilled it into her head the night before. &#x201c;As I&#x2019;m sure you know, the sudoku is a puzzle in which the numbers one through nine appear once and only once in every row and column. The numbers also appear once and only once in the nine boxes of each three-by-three square.&#x201d; Cora pointed them out. &#x201c;There are nine three-by-three squares in the puzzle.&#x201c;A sudoku starts with some of the numbers filled in.&#x201d; Cora pointed to the blackboard. &#x201c;This is an easy sudoku. At least, I hope it is, because I&#x2019;m going to show you how to solve it.&#x201d;&#x201c;Look at the three-by-three square in the upper left hand corner. There&#x2019;s a two, a three, and a four in that square. See if you can figure out where to put a seven.&#x201d;Several hands went up. Someone yelled, &#x201c;Above the four.&#x201d;Cora smiled. &#x201c;I see most of you already know. That&#x2019;s right, a seven goes in the box in the first row across and the third column down. And why does it go there? It can&#x2019;t go in the first column, because there&#x2019;s a seven in the fourth row of that column, and you can&#x2019;t have two sevens in the same column. And it can&#x2019;t go in the second column, because there&#x2019;s a seven in the ninth row of that column. So it must be in the third column. The box in the second row of that column is already filled with a four. The box in the third row is already filled with a three. So the only place it can go is the box in the first row of the third column.&#x201d;Cora curtsied and gestured in the direction of the person who shouted. &#x201c;Which is the box above the four.&#x201c;Using the same sort of logic, we can figure out where the rest of the numbers go.&#x201d;Cora quickly filled in the rest of the puzzle. She flashed her trademark Puzzle Lady smile. &#x201c;And that,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;is how you solve a sudoku.&#x201d;Harvey Beerbaum pushed his way forward. The portly cruciverbalist took the microphone from Cora, flashed her a sly smile. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all well and good, Miss Felton. But, as you point out, that&#x2019;s an easy puzzle. Not very challenging to solve. Wouldn&#x2019;t you like to try something harder?&#x201d;Cora looked Harvey up and down, rolled her eyes at the audience. &#x201c;Write your own punch line, gang. I&#x2019;m afraid to touch that one.&#x201d;Harvey frowned at the laughter, then blushed furiously. &#x201c;I mean a more difficult puzzle. A tougher sudoku. A diabolical one.&#x201d;&#x201c;That sounds scary, Harvey. I&#x2019;m not sure these people are up for that.&#x201d;&#x201c;What do you think, ladies and gentlemen?&#x201d; Harvey said. &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you like to see the Puzzle Lady solve a diabolical sudoku?&#x201d;The audience applauded.&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; Cora said. &#x201c;What do you mean, me? You&#x2019;re the one who suggested it. If anyone&#x2019;s gonna solve it, it ought to be you.&#x201d;Another round of applause greeted that challenge.&#x201c;I will if you will,&#x201d; Harvey said.Cora blinked. &#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we both solve it? At the same time. In front of everybody. And see who finishes first?&#x201d;Becky nudged Aaron. &#x201c;Is this part of the program?&#x201d;&#x201c;No way.&#x201d;&#x201c;You think Cora can take him?&#x201d;Aaron&#x2019;s smile was forced. Becky didn&#x2019;t know Sherry was the Puzzle Lady. Without Sherry, Cora couldn&#x2019;t take him at all.For the moment, however, Cora was tap dancing bravely. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t want to show you up, Harvey,&#x201d; she declared, with a twinkle in her eye.The townspeople hooted and applauded.&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m not worried,&#x201d; Harvey said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve gotten pretty good at these little number things.&#x201d;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s calling them &#x2018;little number things&#x2019; for effect,&#x201d; Cora said. &#x201c;He actually knows they&#x2019;re sudoku. That is how you pronounce it, isn&#x2019;t it, Harvey?&#x201d;&#x201c;You pronounce it very well,&#x201d; Harvey said. &#x201c;But how fast can you <i>solve</i> it?&#x201d;&#x201c;Why? You got an appointment?&#x201d;&#x201c;I actually plan to be here,&#x201d; Harvey said, &#x201c;for the next twenty minutes or so. Which is as long as it should take me to complete the diabolical puzzle. I don&#x2019;t know about you.&#x201d;&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; Cora declared, &#x201c;this is the ultimate of chutzpah. The guy constructs a puzzle, then offers to solve it.&#x201d;&#x201c;I assure you I&#x2019;ve done nothing of the kind,&#x201d; Harvey said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you&#x2019;d accuse me of such a thing. I&#x2019;m suggesting you solve a puzzle constructed by someone else.&#x201d;&#x201c;Some friend of yours?&#x201d; Cora said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m supposed to trust that you haven&#x2019;t had a peek?&#x201d;Cora was having a good time ribbing Harvey. There was no reason in the world why she had to accept his outrageous challenge. If she wanted, she could leave him up onstage solving his own damn diabolical puzzle.&#x201c;Oh, I think you&#x2019;ll find the constructor&#x2019;s credentials unimpeachable.&#x201d; Harvey pulled an envelope from his pocket, and took out a letter. He opened it and read, &#x201c;Dear Harvey. Sorry I couldn&#x2019;t be there in person to help with your charity drive. Please allow me to donate this sudoku. I hope you and the Puzzle Lady have fun solving it.&#x201d;Harvey looked up from the letter and smiled. &#x201c;Sincerely, Will Shortz!&#x201d;THE SUDOKU PUZZLE MURDERS.

Intense, colorful, and dramatic&#x2014;the man who hit a golf ball on the moon&#x2014;he was among the most private of America&#x2019;s public figures and, until his death in 1998, he guarded the story of his life zealously. <br><br><b>Light This Candle</b>, based on Neal Thompson&#x2019;s exclusive access to private papers and interviews with Shepard&#x2019;s family and closest friends&#x2014;including John Glenn, Wally Schirra, and Gordon Cooper&#x2014;offers a riveting, action-packed account of Shepard&#x2019;s life. Among the first men to fly off aircraft carriers, he was one of the most fearless test pilots. He endured long separations from his devoted wife and three daughters to fly dangerous missions, working his way up the ranks despite clashes with authority over his brazen flying maneuvers and penchant for risky pranks. Hugely competitive, he beat out John Glenn for the first Mercury spaceflight and then overcame a rare illness to return to space again on Apollo 14. <br><br>He took every challenge head-on and seemed to win every time. <br><br>Long overdue, <b>Light This Candle</b> is a candid and inspiring account of a bold American life.</p><p>NEAL THOMPSON is a veteran journalist who has worked for the Baltimore Sun, Philadelphia Inquirer, and St. Petersburg Times and has written for numerous national magazines, including Outside, Men&#x2019;s Health, and the Washington Post Magazine. He lives with his wife and their two sons in Asheville, North Carolina, where he is writing a book about moonshine, NASCAR, and the South. Visit his website at www.nealthompson.com."Alan was really kind of a loner"<br><br>Alan Shepard confounded people. He angered, intimidated, and embarrassed them; insulted, taunted, or--worst of all--ignored them. Yet for all his maddening iciness, people were drawn to him, because just beneath his cold shell was an intelligent, curious man who could be charming, hilarious, warm, inviting, generous, and even sexy.<br><br>There was no way to anticipate which of Alan Shepard's personalities would emerge on a given day: aloof and remote one day, buying you drinks the next. Possibly the only consistent aspect of his character was its unpredictable duality. That and the obsessive drive to be, as one astronaut put it, "better than anyone else."<br><br>At every stage of his life, Shepard's effect on family, friends, and colleagues was that of a competitor in a hurry, constantly lurching forward, with no stomach for delays or incompetence. He was attracted to people with something to offer, those with skills, information, or money who could help him achieve his goals. But if you had nothing to offer, "you'd better get out of town," said one longtime friend.<br><br>"He was hard to get to know. But once he put his arm around you, you knew he was there," said astronaut Deke Slayton's wife, Bobbie. "If you were a friend of Al's and you needed something, you could call him and he'd break his neck trying to get it for you. If you were in, you were in. It was just tough to get in."<br><br>Shepard's frenetic, unreadable personality churned behind a pair of wide, wild eyes, his most prominent facial feature. Googly, buggy things. Heavy-lidded, they distended out from deep sockets. When he wasn't smiling--he could ignite a huge smile, too, with long, askew teeth framed by meaty lips--it was the eyes people noticed first. Icy blue and intense sometimes, other times warm and watery, but always open wide.<br><br>Throughout his life, friends and family spoke of the "infamous stare" Shepard could inflict. Confidence, smarts, ego, anger, hunger all poured through his bulgy eyes. But, like mirrors, they worked only one way, giving nothing back.<br><br>Behind the mirrors burbled a mysterious stew of contradictions. He was swaggeringly cocky, often referring to himself in the third person or as "the world's greatest test pilot." And yet he could be humble and self deprecating. Despite a notorious impatience, Shepard also displayed an attention to detail that earned him key assignments as a Navy pilot. "He didn't do anything until he had studied it, tested it, and made damn sure he could do it," said James Stockdale, a onetime test pilot colleague of Shepard's.<br><br>In the cockpit of an airplane, Shepard flew with confidence, without fear, always in control, and with an uncanny spatial awareness that can't be taught. "He could fly anything," one colleague said. Another called him "the best aviator I've ever known." But Shepard also had a persistent habit of infuriating superiors by flouting Navy rules, flying dangerously low over beaches, beneath bridges, and upside down. He was "flamboyant" and "indulgent," growled one former supervisor.<br><br>Though his flamboyant indulgences once took him to the brink of a Navy court-martial, those same flinty qualities earned him a spot as one of the nation's first seven astronauts. "He was an egotist" and "a typical New Englander . . . hard, cold," said one NASA official, Chris Kraft. "But he was all business when it came to flying."<br><br>When he joined the other Mercury Seven astronauts, the same question constantly simmered: Who was Alan Shepard? One astronaut considered him "bitterly competitive, to the point of being cutthroat." Another once accused Shepard of "swindling" him in a business deal. And one astronaut's wife said Shepard "really didn't want to have anything to do with the rest of us, the common folk."<br><br>Indeed, he worked hard at setting himself apart. He'd attend casual backyard barbecues in a suit and tie, and he drove a flashy Corvette for the better part of thirty years. He befriended race car drivers, comedians, pro golfers, and millionaires, collected celebrity friends like Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Mickey Rooney, and Clint Eastwood. Then again, while he often acted the part of a self-sufficient loner with little need for others' company, he was just as often a party boy who loved good pranks and nights of drinking with buddies. Shepard cherished good times and pursued them vigorously. Some guessed that his need for a good time was a necessary counterweight to his constant, annoying competitiveness. Al Neuharth, who founded USA Today, said Shepard "wanted to win, whether it was pool or cards or whatever. He wanted to win, to be number one."<br><br>The privacy fence Shepard erected around the perimeter of his personal life shielded another of the contradictions of his persona: that of a ferocious womanizer and, at the same time, a devoted family man and an unashamed admirer of his wife, Louise.<br><br>Like many Navy men of his day, Shepard successfully navigated among exotic women in the barrooms of international ports of call. He perfected those skills as an celebrity-astronaut; one NASA colleague called him "the biggest flirt in the country--but it went beyond flirting." A fellow test pilot said, "He had a beautiful wife and family. I just never quite understood it. But this was his compulsion."<br><br>And yet, while he rarely spoke of them to his peers, Shepard loved and doted on his wife and two daughters. Few colleagues knew that Shepard also informally adopted a niece (the daughter of his wife's dead sister) and treated her like one of his own. But his strong if imperfect fifty-three-year marriage quietly survived while so many other astronauts' marriages crumbled around him.<br><br>One family friend said Louise grounded her husband: "She was the rock." Astronaut Wally Schirra agreed: "She'd bring Al down to earth a lot."<br><br>In the end, she was probably the only one who really knew him.<br><br>One of the Mercury Seven astronauts once told Life magazine, "You might think you'd get to know someone well after working so closely with him for two years. Well, it's not that way with Shepard. He's always holding something back."<br><br>For all his vexing complexity, however, Shepard was exactly the kind of man NASA wanted. At the height of the cold war, the space agency sought nothing less than "real men . . . perfect physical and emotional and aesthetic specimens."<br><br>In Alan Shepard, NASA got all that and more. A guy who'd fought an evil empire in World War II, landed planes on aircraft carriers during storms and at night, bailed out of test jets ten miles above the Earth, downed cocktails or swatted golf balls with celebrities, water-skied barefoot, raced Corvettes, slept with beautiful women, and became a millionaire--all the things boys and teens want to do when they become men.<br><br>Shepard was a man's man, and others strived to be like him, even if they didn't necessarily like him or considered him an "asshole" or a "son of a bitch," as many did. If Shepard's character was a study in paradox, that's possibly because, as a boy, he was pulled in two directions by parents with opposing but oddly complementary temperaments.<br><br>Both parents came from old-guard New Hampshire stock, with impressive lineages to the seminal Colonial days. But when Alan was born, on November 18, 1923, in an upstairs room at 64 East Derry Road--with its ornate molding, glass doorknobs, and gas lamps in each room--he was immediately positioned between two loving but dissimilar parents, one of them grim and duty-bound, the other boisterous and spirited.<br>East Derry, forty miles northwest of Boston in the southeastern tip of New Hampshire, was a town where everybody knew everyone. Family roots ran deep in such towns, but the Shepard family's roots were among the deepest.<br><br>One side of the family sailed from England in the 1690s, their carpentry and blacksmithing tools in tow, then trekked inland from the coast to the folds and foothills along the Merrimac River. Later they helped draft the Declaration of Independence and fought in the Revolutionary War. Ancestors on the other side of Shepard's family transited with the 102 passengers of the Mayflower, then helped govern the Plymouth Colony.<br><br>Along with Scotch-Irish settlers seeking religious freedom, Shepard's English ancestors carved rural hillsides into potato and dairy farms, which later birthed linen, hat, and shoe factories in a triad of manufacturing towns--Derry, East Derry, and Londonderry.<br><br>The landscape of Shepard's youth was a succulent Americana playground of barnyards and swimming holes, apple orchards and blueberry fields, stone walls framing fields of wildflowers and shadowy forests of white pine carpeted by fern and moss. The unpredictable New Hampshire weather could be both fierce and lovely in a day. Winter brought biting winds and mounds of snow that arrived early and stayed late. Summers were brief, hot, and humid, followed by crisp and spectacularly colorful falls.<br><br>That landscape was sensually depicted in the poems of Robert Frost, who in 1900 bought a farm not far from the Shepards. "To a large extent, the terrain of my poetry is the Derry landscape," Frost once said. "There was something about the experience at Derry which stayed in my mind, and was tapped for poetry in the years that came after."<br><br>The people also made a profound impression: seriously religious, ultraconservative and snobbishly wary of newcomers. Frost once cashed a check at the Derry National Bank--owned by Shepard's grandfather--and forgot to sign his middle name on the check. The teller sniffed, "Since it doesn't cost you anything, we would like your full name."<br><br>Frost often felt like an interloper among haughty, superior people.

In order to afford transport, however, she finds herself indentured to Doran, the snotty son of a fuel mogul who tormented her throughout high school. Solara quickly turns the tables by electronically stunning him and switching master and owner identification bracelets.

Pavel Machotka has photographed the sites of Cezanne&#39;s landscape paintings - whenever possible from the same spot and at the same time of day that Cezanne painted the scenes. Juxtaposing these color photographs with reproductions of the paintings, he offers a dazzling range of evidence to demonstrate how the great painter transformed nature into works of art. Machotka, himself an artist, moves from painting to painting, examining textures and surfaces, pictorial rhythms, and inflections of tone. As he analyzes Cezanne&#39;s treatment of individual sites, their transposition into forms and colors, and the artist&#39;s responsiveness to the demands of each unique composition, we begin to see Cezanne as he saw himself: not as an early Cubist, but as a painter who explored every aspect of his motif for its rich compositional potential and presented a parallel and faithful conception of it. Using color to define form, while retaining hues that are anchored in reality, Cezanne achieved sensuous reconstructions, rather than intellectual depictions like those of the Cubists. While there are other books on Cezanne&#39;s landscapes, none is as closely informed by painterly knowledge and perception or as complete in its grasp of Cezanne&#39;s period and geography as this one. A visual delight, it is also an illuminating and original interaction with the artist&#39;s work.This two-volume set by art history professor Machotka, himself a painter, is a beautiful work of scholarship. The first volume offers 399 color prints of outstanding quality. The second includes series of carefully documented essays that stand alone in examining specific aspects of Cezanne&#39;s career but, taken as whole, provide an insightful overview of the artist&#39;s development. Machotka&#39;s explanation of the narrative paintings is especially noteworthy because he explores how C6zanne&#39;s touch (i.e., the translation of his imagination into line, composition, and brushstroke.) is linked to the artist&#39;s vision and intellectual convictions. This unique book also contains an unexpected treat for librarians: one of the most sensitive, creative indexes this reviewer has ever seen. For example, under &#34;touch.&#34; the subdivisions listed include &#34;as integrating, balancing the composition&#34; and &#34;curved, flocculent, fleccy.&#34; A bravura work; highly recommended.--Katherine Adams, Bowdoin Coll. Lib., Brunswick&#39; ME -- Library Journal, April, 2009.</p><h2>The Ageless Self: Sources of Meaning in Late Life (Life Course Studies)</h2><p><p>Among the many studies of aging and the aged, there is comparatively little material in which the aged speak for themselves. In this compelling study, Sharon Kaufman encourages just such expression, recording and presenting the voices of a number of old Americans. Her informants tell their life stories and relate their most personal feelings about becoming old. Each story is unique, and yet, presented together, they inevitable weave a clear pattern, one that clashes sharply with much current gerontological thought. With this book, Sharon Kaufman allows us to understand the experience of the aging by listening to the aged themselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaufman, while maintaining objectivity, is able to draw an intimate portrait of her subjects. We come to know these people as individuals and we become involved with their lives. Through their words, we find that the aging process is not merely a period of sensory, functional, economic, and social decline. Old people continue to participate in society, and&#x2014;more important&#x2014;continue to interpret their participation in the social world. Through themes constructed from these stories, we can see how the old not only cope with losses, but how they create new meaning as they reformulate and build viable selves. Creating identity, Kaufman stresses, is a lifelong process.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharon Kaufman's book will be of interest and value not only to students of gerontology and life span development, and to professionals in the field of aging, but to everyone who is concerned with the aging process itself. As Sharon Kaufman says, "If we can find the sources of meaning held by the elderly and see how individuals put it all together, we will go a long way toward appreciating the complexity of human aging and the ultimate reality of coming to terms with one's whole life."</p></p><p><p>Sharon R. Kaufman is professor of medical anthropology in the Institute for Health &amp; Aging, Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. She has lectured widely and taught an numerous workshops and seminars. Her work on aging has appeared in several journals, including <i>Ethos and Aging and Human Development</i>, and in other books. She is the author of <i>The Healer's Tale</i>, also published by the University of Wisconsin Press.</p>Despite the interest in the aging process in recent years, few researchers have asked the elderly themselves what it is like to grow old. Anthropologist Kaufman interviewed 60 Californians, aged 60 to 90, about significant events in their pasts, their day-to-day lives now, their thoughts about themselves, and their reflections on aging. She discovered that most older people retain a clear image of themselves over the course of a lifetime and use themes formulated in the past to help understand and cope with life in the present. The narratives developed from six of the interviews are the best feature of this book; the theoretical analysis is interesting but requires a knowledge of social gerontology to be fully appreciated.

As noted Ripperologist Dan Farson observes, "This is indeed the &#x2018;definitive account'," for armchair sleuths of the White Chapel Horrors and all true crime aficionados. "A meticulous and reasoned profile for readers and future detectives."&#x2014;Kirkus Reviews "The charm of well written history about a character of almost mythical standing."&#x2014;Daily Telegraph (London)</p><p>A comprehensive account of London&#39;s celebrated East End killer, revised and updated. The murders in London between 1888-91 attributed to Jack the Ripper constitute one of the most mysterious unsolved criminal cases. This story is the result of many years meticulous research. The author reassesses all the evidence and challenges everything we thought we knew about the Victorian serial killer and the vanished East End he terrorized.This exacting book adds a cogent historical investigation to the relatively few intelligent books about the father of all serial killers. Sensationalistic distortion and overimaginative theorizing have been part of this anonymous criminal's history since the first contemporaneous tabloid stories on the Whitechapel murders and continue in the inquiries of modern ``Ripperologists.'' For example, the letter signed ``Yours truly, Jack the Ripper'' that christened the legend was probably a journalist's headline-grabbing forgery, perpetuated in more hoax letters from the Ripper-crazed public. British historian Sugden corrects such myths and errors with donnish competitiveness, spending only a little time dispatching the more bizarre hypotheses (such as the recent Ripper diary hoax, the fanciful implication of the royal family in the murders, and the innumerable post-Victorian pseudo-suspects). Avoiding the penny-dreadful archives of Ripperology, he diligently approaches the voluminous police work and forensic evidence on the ``canonical'' four victims, all prostitutes, and an equal number of possible ones. Drawing on previous research and his own, he reexamines the eyewitnesses' testimony, inquest reports, newspaper accounts, and police leads (and red herrings). Although the material is still compelling and timely after a century, Sugden's sometimes sluggish prose and narrative do not bring to life the panicked atmosphere of the East End or the tensions within the police department. In the end, though many inconsistencies are swept away and many ambiguities left warily intact, Sugden produces an approximate modus operandi around which a convincing psychological profile can be constructed. His examination of suspects exonerates previous favorites, such as Michael Ostrog, whom Assistant Chief Constable Melville Macnaghten called a ``mad Russian doctor''; but with even his preferred suspect, a Polish con man and poisoner, he reaches the verdict ``not proven.'' Sugden's factual treatment of the murders provides a meticulous and reasoned profile for readers and future detectives. (Photos and maps, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this book, Bruce Frantzis, renowned chi master and author, challenges readers to embark on an inner revolution to reclaim joy and happiness in life, reverse the effects of aging and release their stress and negative emotions.<br><br>Chi adepts can consciously feel and work with all the acupuncture meridians, internal organs and other structures in their own bodies. Yet these are skills that most Westerners would consider to be something out of science fiction and absolutely impossible to achieve in real life.<b> </b>Drawing on forty years of training in ancient Chinese practices, Frantzis provides readers with new and startling insights about how life-force energy&#x2014;chi&#x2014;can help them achieve enduring health and wellbeing. &#x201c;The smooth, balanced flow of your life-force energy is the single most important determinant to your health, vitality and happiness,&#x201d; he says. <br><br>Instead of the &#x201c;no pain, no gain,&#x201d; mantra of our over-caffeinated, stressed out culture, Frantzis gives readers energetic fitness exercises that comprise the unique Chi Rev Workout&#x2122;. These transformative exercises teach readers to activate and strengthen their chi and to relax their nervous systems. &#x201c;The more you relax, the more health, stamina and strength you will have,&#x201d; says Frantzis. <br><br>Frantzis reveals how once closely guarded and ancient secrets of chi are the power behind:<br>&#x2014;Spirituality, prayer and meditation.<br>&#x2014;Acupuncture and the potent self-healing methods of chi gung (qigong) and Taoist yoga.<br>&#x2014;Enhanced sexual vitality and intimate relationships.<br>&#x2014;Internal martial arts, such as tai chi.<br>&#x2014;Divination methods of the <i>I Ching</i>.</p><p>Bruce Frantzis<b> </b>is reputed to be the first Westerner to hold authentic lineages in Taoist energy arts. He studied healing, martial arts and meditation with renowned teachers in Asia for 16 years&#x2014;including training in China for more than a decade.<br><br>Since 1987, Frantzis has taught chi gung, martial arts, TAO yoga, TAO meditation, and energetic-healing therapies to over 15,000 students in the United States and Europe. His teaching methods are spread by a growing number of certified instructors that he has trained in the United States and Europe.<br><br>Frantzis is the author of several widely praised books about the power of chi including: <i>Tai Chi: Health for Life; </i>the chi gung books, <i>Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body </i>and the<i> Dragon and Tiger Medical Chi Gung Instruction Manual; </i>and two volumes on the water method of TAO meditation<i>, Relaxing Into Your Being</i> and <i>The Great Stillness</i>. Two CDs, <i>The Tao of Letting Go</i> and <i>Ancient Songs of the Tao</i>, shed valuable insights into the power of TAO Meditation in helping people let go of their deepest emotional blockages and move closer to becoming truly alive, balanced and joyful.<br><br>When Frantzis moved to China to follow the Taoist path of warrior/healer/priest, he was extensively trained in the chi principles and practices that are the basis of Chinese medicine. From 1974 to 1979, he trained with high-level chi gung tui na (therapeutic energy work) doctors and apprenticed under their tutelage in Chinese medical clinics. He learned to use chi to help heal a wide range of conditions including broken bones, nerve and organ damage and cancer. He also gained an advanced acupuncture degree.<br><br>Frantzis used these chi principles and practices to dramatically heal himself: first from a life-threatening form of hepatitis in India and more dramatically from massive spine injuries that he received in a car accident in 1981.<br><br>Frantzis&#x2019; experiences have made him a teacher with a mission: teaching people how the ancient and proven self-healing chi practices can help them achieve health, relaxation, inner peace and longevity. He aims to help avert a major health crisis that threatens to engulf the Western world.Chi flows like a river through you, following the path of least resistance. When the flow of chi is free, open and unbound, it flows toward positive, life-nurturing forces.... much the same way as a free-flowing river nourishes all life within it and the plants and animals that are fed by it.... When your energy is blocked or trapped, however, it acts much like a river where water backs up and stops flowing, accumulating sludge and gunk.... Its location in the body then becomes susceptible to stress, illness and disease, both physical and mental...Practicing the art of letting go and releasing any buildup of stuck chi, is the principle taught by Taoists for thousands of years and....is the enduring principle behind traditional Chinese medicine. (Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Inner Revolution)<br><br>The Chi Revolution asks you to get out of your head and into your body. In many people, the capacity to go from an external orientation of life to an internal one is severely blocked. Others...are waking up to the fact that no amount of external validation&#x2013;material assets, status, affirmation of others&#x2013;has ever done much to foster inner peace for more than a few fleeting moments. Tuning in to your inner world will not necessary give you the instant gratification that the external world constantly promises. It is a process of becoming whole again, rather than a jumble of disconnected parts without any rhythm or harmony in relation to ourselves and those around us. (Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Inner Revolution)<br><br>* * * * <br><br>Myth # 8: Relaxation is about zoning out and escaping<br>Fact: Relaxation is about tuning into your body and letting go<br><br>Few Westerners have ever experienced deep relaxation. Because they feel stressed most of the time, they are psychologically unprepared for the fact that relaxation can become a norm in life rather than an aberration. It is even more difficult for people to realize that the more relaxed they are, the more energy, stamina, awareness, clarity and strength they will have.<br>Energetic fitness enables the progressive release of tension and anxiety so that it becomes a living reality. It involves turning in to your body and letting go of all your physical, emotional, mental, karmic, psychic and spiritual tension. Letting go means releasing chi blockages. Ultimately it means relaxing the nervous system so chi can strongly flow. Relaxation allows love, happiness and compassion to flourish.<br>(Chapter 6: Twelve Myths of Health and Fitness)</p><h2>Oratio (Or-ought-see-oh): Rhythms of Prayer From the Heart of Christendom</h2><p>Inspired by the call for all of Christ&#39;s faithful to pray with the heart and mind of the universal Church, Oratio gathers the greatest prayers, devotions, and hymns of the last two thousand years into one beautifully formatted, pocket-size book.

Few writers in poetry or prose have attained the lucid intelligence and limpid economy of style that are the trademarks of his work. His wry humor, gentle skepticism, and perpetual sense of history's dark possibilities have earned him a devoted international following. This collection, gracefully translated by Clare Cavanagh, finds the poet returning to the themes that have defined his career&#x2015;moving meditations on place, language, and history. <i>Unseen Hand </i>is a luminous meeting of art and everyday life.</p></p><p><p><b>Adam Zagajewski </b>was born in Lvov in 1945.

He lives in Chicago and Krak�w.</p><p>&#x201c;Not so long ago we had two incredible voices--Neruda and Milosz. Now we have Adam Zagajewski, who also speaks passionately from both the historical and the personal perspective, in poems reduced to a clean, lyrical clarity.

By this we mean the poems move in and out of revealing and concealing, each poem an elegant exploration of history, both personal and global . . . Zagajewski's poetry reflects on the unseen impressions we leave on each other and the physical world around us, the indirect intimacy of human interaction . . . Thoughtful and meditative . . .

Yet these poems oppose grand pronouncements . . . we see Zagajewski's continual evolution toward elegy and memory, but the role of poetry is still both vital and deeply limited . . . these new poems, pitched at a register slightly lower than that of praise, offer a sort of quiet surprise--occasionally even delight--born out of wise and hard-earned skepticism.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publisher's Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;The poems of <i>Unseen Hand</i>, translated by the admirably consistent Clare Cavanagh, move through the various locales of Zagajewski's life; from his Polish upbringing in Lvov and the provincial garrison town of Gliwice . . . to various stints in Krakow, Paris, and Chicago . . . Zagajewski is especially perceptive of the ways the past is channeled through the present -- his &#x2018;now' tends to carry the authority of an &#x2018;always' . . . Zagajewski's skill with subtle tensions doesn't stifle his playful nature . . . As always with Zagajewski, we are ultimately responsible for the way we experience our own lives, how we value the inheritance of the past, and how open we are to those &#x2018;moments without an hour.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Brodeur, The Boston Globe</i></p><p>&#x201c;Zagajewski . . . blends past and present, mundane and mysterious in all his word.

Learn more at www.sherwoodsmith.net.In this lively, accessible follow-up to <i>Inda</i> (2006), Smith dares to resolve several plot lines, in defiance of fantasy sequel conventions. Young prince and military genius Inda, forced to turn mercenary after conspirators engineered his exile from Choraed Elgaer, is gathering allies for a sea campaign against the piratical Brotherhood, while the Sierlaef, heir to the kingdom of Iasca Leror, savors Inda's banishment and plots multiple intrigues. Inda's attention soon shifts toward the ambitious Venn Empire, which wants to use him as a political pawn, and the increasing role of magic in these complex international conflicts, but home and family are always in his thoughts. Smith deftly stage-manages the wide-ranging plots with brisk pacing, spare yet complex characterizations and a narrative that balances sweeping action and uneasy intimacy. Occasional asides in the voice of later historical scholars are a bit disconcerting, but the device is very lightly applied and further demonstrates the depths of Smith's world-building. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Prior to the publication of her first novel, she taught creative writing at Lake Superior State University. She and her husband, Neil, live in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. They have two children.This third book in Harrison's Storyteller trilogy completes the tale begun in her two previous works, <i>Song of the River</i> (1997) and <i>Cry of the Wind</i> (1998). This installment, which, like the others, is set in prehistoric Alaska, features two storytellers: Yikaas, a young, handsome, and fiery-tempered member of the River People tribe; and Qumalix, a beautiful, clever, and high-spirited member of the Sea Hunters tribe. These two quick-witted characters spend their evenings sparring verbally and weaving tales of their historic ancestors for their gathered tribespeople. Their nightly contest to tell the most enchanting tale (and the hint of attraction between them) brings to life legends of the tribes' heroic ancestors, much to the delight of the assembled listeners, while also weaving a dramatic plot for readers to follow.

If you're thinking of taking up children's writing as a lark or as an easy way to make money, my advice is: Forget it. &nbsp; True, there are always those beginning writers who will whip out a children's story, sell it to a publisher on the first try, and wind up with a successful book. But for most of us, entering the profession takes years of practice, self-education, and not a little frustration. And there's more of that after we're published. &nbsp; But if you're serious about writing for children, this book should significantly speed and simplify your professional development. Though not at all meant to be comprehensive, it lays out the basics, points you toward additional resources, and most importantly, provides tips and strategies not commonly found elsewhere. Along with that, it offers detailed looks at some of my own specialties and points out changes due to new technologies. &nbsp; The material comes from several sources. Most of the Introduction and Part 1 is based on handouts created for my former classes and workshops on writing for children. Part 2 consists of articles first written for "Once Upon A Time" or the "SCBWI Bulletin"--the newsletter of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators. All materials were updated as needed for this book. &nbsp; Reflecting my own expertise, the focus here is on writing picture book stories and selling them to traditional publishers. Much of the information, though, will apply to other areas of children's writing as well -- and having dabbled more recently in self publishing, I've added a bit on that too. &nbsp; I hope this guide will help in your professional and/or personal growth. Good luck, and don't forget to have fun! &nbsp; ///////////////////////////////////////////////// &nbsp; A NOTE ON VERSION 2.0 AND THE KINDLE EDITION &nbsp; Over thirteen years ago, I told my now-wife, Anne, that this collection of materials was not really a book, so I didn't think I should publish it. She has been kidding me about that ever since. Because this little non-book went on to become the all-time bestselling children's writing guide on Amazon.&nbsp; &nbsp; Whether that success has been mainly due to this volume's virtues, or clever marketing, or just luck, I can't say. But it has been gratifying to help and influence a generation of new children's writers. And with the newly-revised version 2.0 and the Kindle edition plus their new sequel, "Adventures in Writing for Children," I hope to do the same for the next. &nbsp; ///////////////////////////////////////////////// &nbsp; BOOKS ON CHILDREN'S WRITING BY AARON SHEPARD &nbsp; THE BUSINESS OF WRITING FOR CHILDREN.

He lives in Davis, California.<br><br>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Despair could never touch a morning like this. <br>The air was cool, and smelled of sage. It had the clarity that comes to southern California only after a Santa Ana wind has blown all haze and history out to sea--air like telescopic glass, so that the snowtopped San Gabriels seemed near enough to touch, though they were forty miles away. The flanks of the blue foothills revealed the etching of every ravine, and beneath the foothills, stretching to the sea, the broad coastal plain seemed nothing but treetops: groves of orange, avocado, lemon, olive; windbreaks of eucalyptus and palm; ornamentals of a thousand different varieties, both natural and genetically engineered. It was as if the whole plain were a garden run riot, with the dawn sun flushing the landscape every shade of green. <br>Overlooking all this was a man, walking down a hillside trail, stopping occasionally to take in the view. He had a loose gangly walk, and often skipped from one step to the next, as if playing a game. He was thirty-two but he looked like a boy, let loose in the hills with an eternal day before him. <br>He wore khaki work pants, a tank-top shirt, and filthy tennis shoes. His hands were large, scabbed and scarred; his arms were long. From time to time he interrupted his ramble to grasp an invisible baseball bat and swing it before him in a sharp half swing, crying, "Boom!" Doves still involved in their dawn courtship scattered before these homers, and the man laughed and skipped down the trail. His neck was red, his skin freckled, his eyes sleepy, his hair straw-colored and poking out everywhere. He had a long face with high pronounced cheekbones, and pale blue eyes. Trying to walk and look at Catalina at the same time, he tripped and had to make a quick downhill run to recover his balance. "Whoah!" he said. "Man! What a day!" <br>* * * <br>He dropped down the hillside into El Modena. His friends trickled out of the hills in ones and twos, on foot or bicycle, to converge at a torn-up intersection. They took up pick or shovel, jumped into the rough holes and went to work. Dirt flew into hoppers, picks hit stones with a <i>clink clink clink</i>, voices chattered with the week's gossip. <br>They were tearing out the street. It had been a large intersection: four-lane asphalt streets, white concrete curbs, big asphalt parking lots and gas stations on the corners, shopping centers behind. Now the buildings were gone and most of the asphalt too, hauled away to refineries in Long Beach; and they dug deeper. <br>His friends greeted him. <br>"Hey, Kevin, look what I found." <br>"Hi, Doris. Looks like a traffic light box." <br>"We already found one of those." <br>Kevin squatted by the box, checked it out. "Now we've got two. They probably left it down here when they installed a new one." <br>"What a waste." <br>From another crater Gabriela groaned. "No! No! Telephone lines, power cables, gas mains, PVC tubing, the traffic light network--and now another gas station tank!" <br>"Look, here's a buncha crushed beer cans," Hank said. "At least they did some things right." <br>* * * <br>As they dug they teased Kevin about that night's town council meeting, Kevin's first as a council member. "I still don't know how you let yourself get talked into it," Gabriela said. She worked construction with Kevin and Hank; young, tough and wild, she had a mouth, and often gave Kevin a hard time. <br>"They told me it would be fun." <br>Everyone laughed. <br>"They told him it would be fun! Here's a man who's been to hundreds of council meetings, but when Jean Aureliano tells him they're fun, Kevin Claiborne says, 'Oh, yeah, I guess they are!'" <br>"Well, maybe they will be." <br>They laughed again. Kevin just kept wielding his pick, grinning an embarrassed grin. <br>"They won't be," Doris said. She was the other Green on the council. Having served two terms she would be something like Kevin's advisor, a task she didn't appear to relish. They were housemates, and old friends, so she knew what she was getting into. She said to Gabriela, "Jean chose Kevin because she wanted somebody popular." <br>"That doesn't explain Kevin agreeing to it!" <br>Hank said, "The tree growing fastest is the one they cut first." <br>Gabriela laughed. "Try making sense, Hank, okay?" <br>* * * <br>The air warmed as the morning passed. They ran into a third traffic light box, and Doris scowled. "People were so wasteful." <br>Hank said, "Every culture is as wasteful as it can afford to be." <br>"Nah. It's just lousy values." <br>"What about the Scots?" Kevin asked. "People say they were really thrifty." <br>"But they were poor," Hank said. "They couldn't afford not to be thrifty. It proves my point." <br>Doris threw dirt into a hopper. "Thrift is a value independent of circumstances." <br>"You can see why they might leave stuff down here," Kevin <br>said, tapping at the traffic boxes. "It's a bitch to tear up these streets, and with all the cars." <br>Doris shook her short black hair. "You're getting it backwards, Kev, just like Hank. It's the values you have that drive your actions, and not the reverse. If they had cared enough they would have cleared all this shit out of here and used it, just like us." <br>"I guess." <br>"It's like pedaling a bike. Values are the downstroke, actions are the upstroke. And it's the downstroke that moves things along." <br>"Well," Kevin said, wiping sweat from his brow and thinking <br>about it. "If you've got toeclips on, you can get quite a bit of power on your upstroke. At least I do." <br>Gabriela glanced quickly at Hank. "Power on your upstroke, Kev? Really?" <br>"Yeah, you pull up on the toeclips. Don't you get some thrust that way?" <br>"Shit yeah, Kev, I get a lot of power on my upstroke." <br>"About how much would you say you get?" Hank asked. <br>Kevin said, "Well, when I'm clipped in tight I think I must get twenty percent or so." <br>Gabriela broke into wild cackles. "Ah, ha ha HA! This, ha!--this is the mind about to join the town council! I can't wait! I can't wait to see him get into some heavy debate with Alfredo! Fucking <i>toeclips</i>--he'll be talking TOECLIPS!" <br>"Well," Kevin said stubbornly, "don't you get power on your upstroke?" <br>"But twenty percent?" Hank asked, interested now. "Is that all the time, or just when you're resting your quads?" <br>Doris and Gabriela groaned. The two men fell into a technical discussion of the issue. <br>Gabriela said, "Kevin gets into it with Alfredo, he'll say toeclips! He'll say, 'Watch out, Fredo, or I'll poison your blood!'" <br>Doris chuckled, and from the depths of his discourse Kevin frowned. <br>* * * <br>Gabriela was referring to an incident from Kevin's grade school days, when he had been assigned with some others to debate the proposition, "The pen is mightier than the sword." Kevin had had to start the debate by arguing in favor of the proposition, and he had stood at the head of the class, blushing hot red, twisting his hands, rocking back and forth, biting his lips, blowing out every circuit--until finally he said, blinking doubtfully, "Well--if you had just the pen--and if you stuck someone--they might get blood poisoning from the ink!" <br>Heads to the desks, minutes of helpless howling, Mr. Freeman wiping the tears from his eyes--people falling out of their chairs! No one had ever forgotten it. In fact it sometimes seemed to Kevin that everyone he had ever known had been in that classroom that day, even people like Hank, who was ten years older than him, or Gabriela, who was ten years younger. Everybody! But it was just a story people told. <br>* * * <br>They dug deeper, ran into rounded sandstone boulders. Over the eons Santiago Creek had wandered over the alluvial slopes tailing out of the Santa Ana Mountains, and it seemed all of El Modena had been the streambed at one time or another, because they found these stones everywhere. The pace was casual; this was town work, and so was best regarded as a party, to avoid irritation at the inefficiency. In El Modena they were required to do ten hours a week of town work, and so there were opportunities for vast amounts of irritation. They had gotten good at taking it less than seriously. <br>Kevin said, "Hey, where's Ramona?" <br>Doris looked up. "Didn't you hear?" <br>"No, what?" <br>"She and Alfredo broke up." <br>This got the attention of everyone in earshot. Some stopped and came over to get the story. "He's moved out of the house, on to Redhill with his partners." <br>"You're kidding!" <br>"No. I guess they've been fighting a lot more lately. That's what everyone at their house says. Anyway, Ramona went for a walk this morning." <br>"But the game!" Kevin said. <br>Doris jabbed her shovel into dirt an inch from his toe. "Kevin, did it ever occur to you that there are more important things than softball?" <br>"Well sure," he said, looking dubious at the proposition. <br>"She said she'd be back in time for the game." <br>"Good," Kevin said, then saw her expression and added quickly, "Too bad, though. Really too bad. Quite a surprise, too." <br>He thought about Ramona Sanchez. Single for the first time since ninth grade, in fact. <br>Doris saw the look on his face and turned her back on him. Her stocky brown legs were dusty below green nylon shorts; her sleeveless tan shirt was sweaty and smudged. Straight black hair swung from side to side as she attacked the ground. "Help me with this rock," she said to Kevin sharply, back still to him. Uncertainly he helped her move yet another water-rounded blob of sandstone. <br>* * * <br>"Well, if it isn't the new council at work," said an amused baritone voice above them. <br>Kevin and Doris looked up to see Alfredo Blair himself, seated on his mountain bike. The bright titanium frame flashed in the sun. Without thinking Kevin said, "Speak of the devil." <br>"Well," Doris said, with a quick warning glance at Kevin, "if it isn't the new mayor at leisure." <br>Alfredo grinned rakishly. He was a big handsome man, black-haired, moustached, clear clean lines to his jaw, nose, forehead. It was hard to imagine that just the day before he had moved out of a fifteen-year relationship. <br>"Good luck in your game today," he said, in a tone that implied they would need it, even though they were only playing the lowly Oranges. Alfredo's team the Vanguards and their team the Lobos were perpetual rivals; before today this had always been a source of jokes, as Ramona was on the Lobos. Now Kevin wasn't sure what it was. Alfredo went on: "I'm looking forward to when we get to play you." <br>"We've got work to do, Alfredo," Doris said. <br>"Don't let me stop you. Town work benefits everyone." He laughed, biked off. "See you at the council meeting!" he yelled over his shoulder. <br>They went back to work. <br>"I hope when we play them we beat the shit out of them," Kevin said. <br>"You always hope that." <br>"True." <br>Kevin and Alfredo had grown up on the same street, and had shared many classes in school, including the class assigned to debate the proposition. So they were old friends, and Kevin had had many opportunities to watch Alfredo operate in the world, and he knew well that his old friend was a very admirable person--smart, friendly, popular, energetic, successful. Good at everything; everything came easily to him and everyone liked him. <br>But it was too nice a day to let the thought of Alfredo wreck it. <br>Besides, Alfredo and Ramona had broken up. Obscurely cheered by the thought, Kevin hauled a boulder up into a hopper. <br>When they stopped for lunch they were about eye-level with the old surface of the intersection, which was now a chaotic field of craters, pocked by trenches and treadmarks, with wheelbarrows and dumpsters all over. Kevin squinted at the sight and grinned. <br>"This is gonna make one hell of a softball diamond." <br>* * * <br>After lunch the spring softball season began. Players biked into Santiago Park from all directions, bats over handlebars, and they fell collectively into time-honored patterns; for softball is a ritual activity, and the approach to ritual is also ritualized. Feet were shoved into stiff cleats, gloves were slipped on, and they walked out onto the green grass field and played catch in groups of two and three, the big balls floating back and forth, making a dreamy knitwork of white lines in the air. <br>The umpires were running their chalk wheelbarrows up the foul lines when Ramona Sanchez coasted to the third base side and dumped her bike. Long legs, wide shoulders, Hispanic coloring, black hair.&#x2026;The rest of the Lobos greeted her happily, relieved to see her, and she smiled and said, "Hi, guys," in almost her usual way; but everyone could see she wasn't herself. <br>Ramona was one of those people who always have a bright smile and a cheery tone of voice. Doris for one found it exasperating. "She's a biological optimist," Doris would grouse, "it isn't even up to her. It's something in her blood chemistry." <br>"Wait a second," Hank would object, "you're the one always talking about values--shouldn't optimism be the result of will? I mean, <i>blood chemistry</i>?" <br>And Doris would reply that optimism might indeed be an act of will, but that good looks, intelligence and great athletic skill no doubt helped to make it a rather small one; and these qualities were all biological, even if they weren't blood chemistry. <br>Anyway, the sight of Ramona on this day was a disturbing thing: an unhappy optimist. Even Kevin, who started to play catch with her with the full intention of behaving normally, thus giving her a break from unwanted sympathy, was unnerved by how subdued she seemed. He felt foolish trying to pretend all was well, and since she ignored his pretense he just caught and threw, warming her up. <br>Judging by the hard flat trajectory of her throws, she was considerably warm already. Ramona Sanchez had a good arm; in fact, she was a gun. Once Kevin had seen one of her rare wild throws knock a spoke cleanly out of the wheel of a parked bike, without moving the rest of the bike an inch. She regularly broke the leather ties in first basemen's gloves, and once or twice had broken fingers as well. Kevin had to pay close attention to avoid a similar fate, because the ball jumped across the space between them almost instantaneously. A real gun. And not in a good mood. <br>So they threw in silence, except for the leather smack of the glove. There was a certain companionableness about it, Kevin felt--a sort of solidarity expressed. Or so he hoped, since he couldn't think of anything to say. Then the umpires called for the start of the game, and he walked over and stood beside her as she sat and jammed on her cleats. She did it with such violence that it seemed artificial not to notice, so Kevin said, hesitantly, "I heard about you and Alfredo." <br>"Uh huh," she said, not impressed. <br>"I'm sorry."...</p><h2>Charles R.

Face-to-face contact matters: tight bonds of friendship and love heal us, help children learn, extend our lives, and make us happy. Looser in-person bonds matter, too, combining with our close relationships to form a personal &#x201c;village&#x201d; around us, one that exerts unique effects. Not just any social networks will do: we need the real, in-the-flesh encounters that tie human families, groups of friends, and communities together.<br> &nbsp;<br> Marrying the findings of the new field of social neuroscience with gripping human stories, Susan Pinker explores the impact of face-to-face contact from cradle to grave, from city to Sardinian mountain village, from classroom to workplace, from love to marriage to divorce. Her results are enlightening and enlivening, and they challenge many of our assumptions. Most of us have left the literal village behind and don&#x2019;t want to give up our new technologies to go back there. But, as Pinker writes so compellingly, we need close social bonds and uninterrupted face-time with our friends and families in order to thrive&#x2014;even to survive. Creating our own &#x201c;village effect&#x201d; makes us happier. It can also save our lives.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Village Effect</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;The benefits of the digital age have been oversold.

Five foot ten, with rectangular tortoiseshell glasses and pixie-�cut hair, Sylvie favored snug wraparound tops she sewed herself, worn over leggings and boots; she hardly looked the part of a grandmother of three. A real estate agent and interior designer, she was the de facto hub of several intense face-�to-�face social networks, including her swim team. Its president for seven years by that time, she fielded a multitude of personal and training questions from its 150 members, including but not limited to their health issues, reproductive concerns and sports injuries, marital flare-�ups and child-�rearing doubts, thoughts on the pool&#x2019;s water quality and the coach&#x2019;s latest endurance workout. She was even a shoulder to cry on when a member&#x2019;s beloved pet had to be put down. She sustained this role with bemused equanimity until a teammate blasted her&#x2014;�and not for the first time&#x2014;�about some insignificant mishap at a competition. The attack penetrated her usual defenses and really stung. Given her recent cancer diagnosis, Sylvie wondered whether she should pull back from the team in order to conserve her emotional resources.<br><br>But she found that it wasn&#x2019;t that simple for her to withdraw. Not only did people keep seeking her out for advice, Sylvie couldn&#x2019;t resist getting involved when there was work to be done. Along with being swim team president, she was also president of a rural homeowners association that had recently planted sixty thousand trees to naturalize communally owned farmland (she had planted fifteen thousand of them herself). She unwittingly drew confidences from people she barely knew&#x2014;�which puzzled her, as she tended to keep her own counsel. I was just one of what seemed like several hundred swim buddies, colleagues, and neighbors who considered Sylvie a friend. And that was just her middle social layer: she had many closer friends too.<br><br>Sylvie and her husband had formed strong bonds with several navy couples while he was enlisted and their kids were young. Closer still were three couples she had met through the swim team; they now dined and traveled together whenever they got the chance. When Gary, one of these close swim friends, found out he had colon cancer, the same week Sylvie received her diagnosis, she competed alongside him at the national championships, then threw herself into his care, organizing tag teams to drive him to the hospital and helping to coordinate his treatment regimen. Supporting Gary as he fought his six-�month survival estimate became her most pressing project. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t sick. He was,&#x201d; she flatly retorted when I asked why she talked about Gary when I asked about her own health. (Gary outlived his initial prognosis by three and half years.) &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t really need anything at the time. Breast cancer is not something that hurts, you know. It&#x2019;s very mental.&#x201d;<br><br>Not everyone would agree with this assessment. What&#x2019;s indisputable is that despite her vow to withdraw, Sylvie continued to be deeply immersed in several face-�to-�face social networks that involved taking care of other people. Though cancer did prompt her to give up her leadership roles for a while, she still swam with the team, entertained family and friends, and took care of people in her circle she thought needed her help. Few see looking after others as therapeutic for the person who does the caretaking, or consider community involvement as therapeutic as drugs. Yet there is mounting evidence that a rich network of face-�to-�face relationships creates a biological force field against disease.<br><br>What Is Social Contact, Really?<br><br>As is true of many women, Sylvie&#x2019;s social connections were so deftly woven into the fabric of her daily life that she didn&#x2019;t see them as remarkable. Yet even if she was blind to the benefits, her social entanglements would stand her in good stead as she faced down her own cancer. That&#x2019;s a handy side benefit of social interaction. Unlike a placebo, which requires you to believe you are receiving medical attention, face-�to-�face social bonds bolster our immune responses by stealth. No needles pierce the skin. Nothing gets swallowed, inserted, or inhaled. Outside Latin cultures, most social contact doesn&#x2019;t even involve the laying on of hands. So how does social contact exert its effects?<br><br>To begin with, the right kind of social contact (hostility doesn&#x2019;t work) instructs the body to secrete more endogenous opiates, which act as local painkillers, and fewer hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline, and corticosteroids&#x2014;�the body&#x2019;s often destructive answer to immediate stressors&#x2014;�which can wage an ongoing war on our tissues and our physical resilience. More and more proof is emerging that in many cases, full social lives can slow down, if not halt, an existing cancer&#x2019;s progress. How a complex, interwoven social life can bolster survival in the face of a grave illness is the story I&#x2019;ll tell in this chapter. I&#x2019;m not referring here to the number of Facebook friends or Twitter followers you&#x2019;ve accumulated simply by clicking &#x201c;invite&#x201d; or &#x201c;accept,&#x201d; but to something more concrete.<br><br>Think of social contact as having three prongs or arms of support. One is a route to timely information that&#x2019;s uniquely valuable to you. In the case of breast cancer, these are the friends and family&#x2014;�and the people they know&#x2014;�who refer you to surgeons and oncologists with good track records, to clinical trials and experimental drugs, and to reliable facts while you sojourn in the disorienting land of chronic illness. When Sylvie was diagnosed, she asked a swim buddy who was a medical researcher for the name of a good surgeon. Seven years later, when a suspicious mass was found in my right breast, I asked Sylvie if she could help and she passed that name on to me. I was three connections away from information critical to my health, and her word-�of-�mouth testimonial damped down my anxiety as I considered my next step. (As you read on, you&#x2019;ll see that the number three keeps resurfacing as I describe how information and trends get transmitted within social groups.)<br><br>Lifts to the doctor&#x2019;s office, sitting with the patient while there, babysitting, and preparing meals comprise that second arm of social support: material assistance. One husband I read about in The New York Times perfected the &#x201c;ask&#x201d; when coordinating crucial social support for his wife, Alexandra Bloom, a forty-�one-�year-�old psychologist and mother of their four-�year-�old twins. Describing himself as highly organized, Tom Nishioka swung into action when his wife learned she had breast cancer:<br><br>Within days, Mr. Nishioka and three friends designed a website for people to sign up to help them. It&#x2019;s hard to ask people things like, &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s comfortable sitting through chemo with you, or who likes to cook?&#x201d; said Dr. Bloom. Ten team captains signed up to organize researching oncologists and health-�insurance options, making home-�cooked meals, shopping for groceries, going on doctor visits, taking the girls to and from school, and tidying up the apartment each day. More than 150 friends signed on. Three are honorary grandmas, Dr. Bloom said. &#x201c;Each of them visits once a week. They read books to the girls, they bring the girls their favorite foods, like string cheese, strawberries and blueberries. They see their role as spoiling them.&#x201d;<br><br>This extraordinary couple recognized that their face-�to-�face social networks were a critical factor in Dr. Bloom&#x2019;s recovery. The Internet was a part of their communication plan, to be sure. Their friends signed up to help on a dedicated website. But when it came to pitching in, the members of their village had to show up; they had to be there, in person. And of course, providing food, rides, and other favors is not all that close friends and family have to offer. They also encourage you to eat, to take your medication, to see the doctor&#x2014;�and perhaps come along to ask probing questions while you&#x2019;re there.<br><br>Along with this concrete support is the mood-� and health-�bolstering effect of having loved ones nearby&#x2014;�the third arm of support. Perhaps this is why people without such social buttressing are more than twice as likely to die prematurely than those with active face-�to-�face social lives. In fact, neglecting to keep in close contact with people who are important to you is at least as dangerous to your health as a pack-�a-�day cigarette habit, hypertension, or obesity. And while the first benefit of social contact I described&#x2014;�access to timely information&#x2014;�has been beautifully streamlined by Google searches, the last two benefits&#x2014;�concrete and emotional support&#x2014;�work most powerfully if those people are near enough to see, hear, and touch you.<br><br>Social Contact and the Shape-�Shifting Disease<br><br>Proving the link between social contact and cancer survival is not just complex from a scientific point of view, it&#x2019;s also controversial. On the complex side, your genes, history of pregnancy and childbirth (or childlessness), hormone levels, menopause, hormone replacement therapy and its timing, diet, exercise, alcohol and cigarette habits, radiation exposure, where you live and the nature of the social and work life you lead there are just some of the factors that combine to create the toxic brew that causes cancer cells to proliferate . . . or not. The sheer number of causes and the way they shift and interact over time make for a seemingly impenetrable tangle. To add to the mess, cancer seems to be not one disease but several hundred that share a common process&#x2014;�that of unchecked hegemonic growth&#x2014;�one reason why the oncologist and author Siddhartha Mukherjee refers to cancer in his book, The Emperor of All Maladies, as &#x201c;a shape-�shifting disease of colossal diversity.&#x201d; Still, when researchers attempt to isolate each of these factors and hold them constant, the link between consistent social contact and breast cancer survival remains.<br><br>But what does this mean exactly? Social contact can be a grab bag of connections. There&#x2019;s the intimate encouragement and support offered by your life partner or best friend, the day-�to-�day contact with colleagues, neighbors, or teammates; the loose affiliations to people you meet in your professional networks or at church. Compare these types of contact to what you experience when you meet strangers in a cancer support group or on Facebook. Though evidence tells us that social connections are as protective as regular exercise&#x2014;�those with the most face-�to-�face connections have a two-�and-�a-�half-�year survival advantage over those with the same disease who are isolated&#x2014;�not all types of social contact are created equal.<br><br>Some cancers are the body&#x2019;s terrorists: they&#x2019;re rare, swift, and indiscriminate killers. In contrast, breast cancer&#x2019;s growth patterns are usually lazier. Given its longer horizon, the vast numbers of people affected, and the political will (and the research budgets that follow suit), breast cancer survival rates are a good way to examine whether social bonds can slow or halt the march of this disease. And as of the 1990s, multiple studies have shown that women with breast cancer who feel supported by caring friends and family&#x2014;�and who actively seek out such social contact&#x2014;�have a more favorable response to the disease and ultimately a better prognosis. More than any other factor, a woman&#x2019;s network of active social contacts and her perception of social support predict her blood levels of lymphocytes and natural killer cells, both of which eradicate cancer cells. Though she is just one case, this was certainly true of Sylvie. She thinks of herself as an introvert. But she surrounded herself with people who mattered, and as a result she not only felt supported but survived.<br><br>The question is how. Two types of studies do a good job of connecting the dots between our social bonds and our health. The first are demographic sweeps that probe the social lives of thousands of people at a time and then follow them into the future&#x2014;�as they get older and start to fall apart. The scientists at the helm of these studies, neck-�deep in data for decades, draw lines between the number and types of get-�togethers with friends, colleagues, kids, cousins, and fellow parishioners penciled in on their calendars and what kind of health problems hit these people, and when.<br><br>In the seventies, Harvard epidemiologist Lisa Berkman was the first to conduct population studies that made the link between our social lives and our &#x201c;best by&#x201d; dates. She lived in northern California at the time, and her study of every single Alameda County resident (a total of 6,928) showed that, among other surprising findings, the women who were socially isolated had an elevated risk of dying of cancer, and isolated men who already had cancer were more likely to die prematurely.<br><br>The sheer volume of participants in studies like Berkman&#x2019;s makes certain links indisputable. We know that the connection between social involvement and robust physical and mental health is no fluke, and that the benefits of regular social contact are at least as powerful as regular exercise and a healthy diet. But the downside of such large-�scale population studies is that, though they prove that two factors are connected, they can&#x2019;t tell us which one comes first. Do people with lots of friends and family live longer because their active social lives protect them from cardiovascular events and cancer? Or are the type of people who seek out lots of interaction with friends, children, parents, cousins, neighbors, and colleagues simply the type of folks who are also biologically destined to live long, healthy lives, come what may? If people who are less healthy in general have a hard time developing and maintaining connections with other people, then it may not be their social isolation that&#x2019;s at the heart of the matter, but their poor health.<br><br>The way to solve this chicken-�and-�egg dilemma is to randomly assign people to one of two groups. In the first they are surrounded by solicitous buddies and loving kin, and in the second they live a monastic life. Meanwhile, everything else stays the same. They start out healthy and cancer free; they have similar genetic, lifestyle, and health backgrounds; they&#x2019;re the same sex and age; and they&#x2019;re similarly privileged, deprived, or addicted in the food, drink, and comfort departments. Then you watch what happens as time passes. Does social contact affect the growth of cancerous tumors?<br><br>We can&#x2019;t try this sort of experiment with human beings, of course. Even if it were possible, it&#x2019;s not ethical to deprive people of social contact just to see what might go wrong. But you can try it with rats, which despite their serious image problem share almost all the genes linked to human diseases and like us, are also highly social animals. When research psychologist Martha McClintock, her oncologist collaborator Suzanne Conzen, and their colleagues tried isolating red-�eyed albino rats bred for research purposes, the team made a remarkable discovery. Socially isolated female lab rats developed eighty-�four times as many breast cancer tumors as female rats who lived in groups. Eighty-�four times! Published at the end of 2009, their study drily relates this extraordinary finding: &#x201c;Isolation increased the number of discrete tumor masses by 135%. Among isolates, tumors were more widespread, developing in three if not all four mammary quadrants.&#x201d; The researchers go on to report that 50 percent of the isolated female rats developed malignant breast cancer, while the incidence among their group-�housed mates was only 15 percent...</p><h2>Freddie&#39;s Spaghetti</h2><p>It&#39;s easy - and fun - to help your child learn to read!

"Damn it, Roy, you hit me with a catfish again and I'm gonna--" Whoa. Everything was dark in her cramped trailer. There was no catfish, no little brother Roy pretending innocence. Of course she'd been dreaming, because Roy was twenty-six now, not ten. Still a complete pain in the ass, though.She swiped at the cold rivulets of wetness running down her face. "What was that?" she muttered to no one in particular. "And why the hell am I wet?""You gots a s'imming pool inside."Bobbie Faye squinted in the half-dark and focused on Stacey, her five-year-old niece, whose blond pigtails were haloed in the blue bug light emanating from just outside the trailer window. Then she peered at the wet Nerf bat Stacey dropped to the floor.Check that. A Nerf bat floating a good two inches above the lime green shag carpet."Shit!" Bobbie Faye stood, flinching as the icy water covered her ankles. "Fuck. Damn fuck fuckity shit.""Mamma says you shouldn't cuss so much.""Yeah? Well your mamma should quit drinking, too, kid, but that ain't likely to happen either."Shit. That was evil. She checked Stacey's reaction, but her niece was preoccupied with the soggy Nerf bat again and hadn't seemed to hear. Thank God. She didn't mean to harm the little rug rat.

Somehow, she was supposed to fix . . . whatever the hell this mess was . . . in time to preside at the opening ceremony of the Contraband Days Festival and get back before four-thirty to prove she could be a good foster parent while Lori Ann was pulling her court-ordered four-month drying-out stint at the Troy House.Oh, flipping yippee.Water splashed against her knees, and she looked down at Lori-Ann's little ankle biter stomping on the carpet as they squish-squished their way down the hall."Your hippos are s'imming." Stacey laughed, pointing at the glow-in-the-dark hippos dancing across Bobbie Faye's thin white cotton PJs. Then the monster child jumped again, hard, splashing water up to Bobbie Faye's elbows."For Christ's sake, Stacey, if you hop around one more time, I'm gonna turn you into a frog."Stacey giggled, but at least she stopped jumping.Bobbie Faye stood in front of the cramped utility closet of her tiny, dark trailer and glared at the culprit: her washing machine, run amok. Water geysered from somewhere behind the vibrating piece-of-crap appliance. If she'd had a gun, she'd have shot it. Several times. Happily. She twisted knobs, pressing buttons broken so long ago, there was no telling what they had originally been meant to do.She wanted to stomp or snarl that this was so not happening to her, but she was awake enough now to be mature in front of Stacey. She could do mature. She was twenty-eight years old, the oldest sibling and the one the other two constantly turned to when they screwed up; of course she could do mature. And solve problems. She was a paragon of problem-solving, and she slammed her fist down on the machine, hoping to dislodge whatever it was that was causing the crisis. The machine shuddered, the water gushed higher, and in that moment, seriously mature went straight to hell. Bobbie Faye hauled off and kicked the machine, then yelped and squirmed in pain because frozen toes do not take too well to sudden impact with metal.Bobbie Faye squeezed her eyes shut, hopping on the other foot and biting her lip to keep from spouting a new stream of expletives. Way to use a brain cell, genius. Stacey took one gander at the hopping and went straight back to jumping with the enthusiasm of a five-year-old on a post-Easter-morning sugar high, soaking everything in her path.And this is the kid who throws a tantrum if I even look like it's time for her bath.There were two things Bobbie Faye knew for certain. One, a day without disaster would be a day in someone else's life. And two, she was going to kill her brother Roy for not showing up to fix the washing machine like he'd promised.She sloshed through the kitchen to the back door and opened it, hoping the water would rush out; it barely trickled. The trailer floor had already sagged below the threshold, turning her ancient trailer into a bowl.Wonderful. The bathtub leaks, the trailer doesn't.Bobbie Faye slumped a moment, barely resisting the urge to pound her head against the door frame. This was her one day off. She'd worked extra hours all week just to be able to relax this morning and take her time to get ready for the festival's opening ceremonies. She hadn't thought anything could top the thunderstorm that blew through on last year's opening day and knocked a tree onto her first truly pretty car, a slightly banged-up purple Nissan 300ZX. Sure, it was used, high mileage, and pulled heavily to the left, but it was shiny, with only two rust spots. The tree could have fallen in any other direction and nothing would have been damaged. Of course, that would mean this was someone else's life. It didn't help when she learned she had, just that day, received a cancellation notice from her car insurance. (Not a single person, not even her friends, ever believed she really hadn't seen that fire truck barreling through the intersection with all of its lights on and sirens blazing. She thought the fireman was clearly at fault, though she did feel pretty awful when, to avoid hitting her, he slid into a light pole, knocking it through the roof of the grocery store on the corner.) Her insurance company paid all of the claims. And canceled her.The bastards.But this year? It was going to be different; she was going to have a pleasant, peaceful day if she had to maim and kill to get it. There were no storms, the insurance was paid up on the rickety cracker-box-on-wheels Honda Civic she'd bought to replace her cool little sports car, she had planned to have plenty of time to get ready and avoid the traffic jams, she had washed her clothes last night and all she'd had to do was toss them into the dryer. . . . So, of course, she was standing in two inches of water inside her trailer.There was no way in hell she was bailing all of this by herself. Roy was going to get his sorry ass over here and help. She went to the phone to call him, flipped on the living room light and gasped. Waves rippled across the floor. Water slapped at the bottom of the more-shabby-than-chic sofa and chair and filled the video bay of her ancient VCR set on the low shelf below the TV. And on the carpet near the sofa where she'd left it was her mom's Contraband Days scrapbook. Drowned.Bobbie Faye's face hurt with the strain of holding back tears. Her mother had kept that scrapbook for more than twenty years. When Bobbie Faye was seven, her mom had let her glue a pirate eye patch on the cover, denoting the history of the festival. Well, her mom had been drinking and hadn't really seemed to notice the eye patch and sequins until a few days later, but she let Bobbie Faye keep them on there and showed them proudly to her friends, so that was almost as good, especially when her mom made her an eye patch to wear to that year's pirate costume contest.Pirates, Bobbie Faye had learned the way other kids learned catechism, had found the multitude of bayous and marshlands in south Louisiana perfect for transporting loot and contraband into the growing territory. The pirates had hidden in south Louisiana for the same reasons the Cajuns had fled there from Nova Scotia: sanctuary. It was a place to be whoever the hell you wanted to be. A close-knit, family sort of place, where watching your neighbor's back was as standard as having a nodding awareness that they just might be crazy as loons, and that was okay, too.After years of digging up half of Calcasieu Parish in a vain attempt to find the buried treasure, the locals eventually, reluctantly, gave up. Well, not entirely. Bobbie Faye remembered when she was a kid and learned there was a place named Contraband Bayou which was said to have been the home of a few pirates who supposedly hid jewels and gold somewhere back where the bayou ended. She tagged along when Roy and Lori Ann's dad took them fishing because he was going to go right by the famous bayou and Bobbie Faye was sure if he'd just let her out, she'd find that treasure. All she got for her trouble was a bad case of poison sumac and a good view of a bunch of deeply dug holes. So much for history.As it was, history settled lazily into myth, which eased along into celebration, and the Contraband Days Festival was born. It was a crazy, lively festival where everyone dressed up as pirates for twelve days in May for parties, music, dancing, and all sorts of events. Tractor pulls! Races! Parades! Buccaneers! There were "official" pageants every year, but Bobbie Faye's mom (and her mom before her, and so on) were the unofficial "Queens"--a title started so far back in time, no one really remembered how it was handed down generation to generation. Bobbie Faye's mom had kept a scrapbook of all her Contraband memories . . . and gave it to Bobbie Faye just before she died, when she had also passed her the duty of being Queen.Bobbie Faye pulled the scrapbook out of the water, her heart sinking as she slowly turned the first sodden page. Spidery scrawl ran in an inky river, washing most of the words to nothingness; the water had faded the old photos to murky shadows and all of the mementos were a soggy mess. The once-dried petals of a rose her mother had worn on her last parade fell apart under Bobbie Faye's touch.Fury slammed her adrenaline up another notch; at any moment, the back of her head was going to pop clean off, especially as the cold water wicked farther up her PJs. The scrapbook was Bobbie Faye's hold on a tenuous place, the "before" as she liked to think about it. Before her mom started wearing the big floppy hats when her hair was getting inexplicably thinner and thinner, before she started wearing the weird combination of clothes and her morning eggs smelled just a shade more like rum than eggs ought to smell, before Bobbie Faye recognized her mom was a little too dancey-happy most days, jitterbugging on the coffee table (before it broke), before Bobbie Faye knew what the word cancer meant. She looked back at the destroyed scrapbook she held. If Roy had shown up like he promised and fixed the damned washing machine, this wouldn't have happened. Bobbie Faye stared out her front window, past the gravel road, and fantasized briefly that she could zero in on wherever Roy was with a laser intensity that would fry his ass on the spot.There was just no telling where he was, and getting him on the cell phone would take an act of God. Check that. It would take an act of some willing life-sized Barbie type. He could be anywhere: his fishing camp south of her trailer park, where there were hundreds of little bayous and marshy wetlands (or as Roy put it, plenty of escape routes); or, just north of her trailer park, hiding in a hole-in-the-wall bar somewhere in the muddy industrial city of Lake Charles, a place Bobbie Faye thought of as the kind of cranky, independent southern town that had never really given a rip what its image might be, although if someone had labeled it "home of the hard drinkers who make Mardi Gras revelers look like big fluffy candy-asses," it might have staggered to attention and saluted. Knowing Roy the way she did, she figured he wasn't anywhere near his own apartment in the heart of the city. Probably in some stupid poker game or, God help him, at one of his many girlfriends' places. He can run, she thought, but he can't hide.Copyright � 2007 by Toni McGee Causey.

In the other, a devout if bad-tempered old composer of &#x2018;outdated&#x2019; music, a scorned genius in his last years. The sparks from their brief conflict illuminate a turbulent age.</p><p>Behind the pomp and flash, Prussia's Frederick the Great was a tormented man, son of an abusive king who forced him to watch as his best friend (probably his lover) was beheaded. In what may have been one of history's crueler practical jokes, Frederick challenged &#x2018;old Bach&#x2019; to a musical duel, asking him to improvise a six-part fugue based on an impossibly intricate theme (possibly devised for him by Bach's own son).</p><p>Bach left the court fuming, but in a fever of composition, he used the coded, alchemical language of counterpoint to write &#x2018;A Musical Offering&#x2019; in response. A stirring declaration of faith, it represented &#x2018;as stark a rebuke of his beliefs and world view as an absolute monarch has ever received,&#x2019; Gaines writes. It is also one of the great works of art in the history of music.</p><p>Set at the tipping point between the ancient and the modern world, the triumphant story of Bach's victory expands to take in the tumult of the eighteenth century: the legacy of the Reformation, wars and conquest, the birth of the Enlightenment. Brimming with originality and wit, &#x2018;Evening in the Palace of Reason&#x2019; is history of the best kind &#x2013; intimate in scale and broad in its vision.</p></p><p><p>Johann Sebastian Bach created what may be the most celestial and profound body of music in history; Frederick the Great built the colossus we now know as Germany, and along with it a template for modern warfare. Their fleeting encounter in 1757 signals a unique moment in history where belief collided with the cold certainty of reason. Set at the tipping point between the ancient and modern world, <em>Evening in the Palace of Reason</em> captures the tumult of the eighteenth century, the legacy of the Reformation, and the birth of the Enlightenment in this extraordinary tale of two men.</p><p>Jim Gaines was the first editor in chief of People magazine, as well as the editor of Time magazine.

The direct oil painting technique is an intense reaction to nature, a race with time to capture the color, the light and shadow, the design and the spirit of a subject in a few short hours. And now, Emile Gruppe - master of the direct oil painting technique - shows how you can use the broad strokes and lively colors of this spontaneous approach to infuse your own paintings with vitality, vigor, and on-the-spot freshness. A firm believer in using the best materials for the best results, Gruppe begins with a quick review of his favorite brushes, colors, easels, and painting surfaces. Next, he covers the basics of good design, what to look for and how to orchestrate what you see: masses, lines, values, and relationships. Turning to color, a fundamental element of his painting technique, Gruppe discusses complements, color harmony, color vibration, local color, reflected color, and using color to create atmospheric perspective. He explains how color appears on various kinds of days - foggy, clear, cloudy - and under different lighting conditions - front lighting, backlighting, sidelighting. In subsequent chapters, the author focuses on composing seascapes and landscapes; he explains how to paint rocks, ocean, lighthouses, boats, piers, pilings, roads, trees, streams, snow, mountains, valleys. Then, in full-color step-by-step demonstrations, the author shows how he captures a subject in his unique, exuberant, on-the-spot style. The text is illuminated by oil sketches and finished paintings by the author, reproduced here in black and white and in color. Gruppe&#39;s instructions are explicit, his enthusiasm contagious; his vivid book is sure to inspire you to develop your own direct oil painting technique.&#34; Hardcover, 168 pages, 8.25 x 11 inches, 139 black and white illustrations, 29 full-color plates.

Night Shyamalan Risked His Career on a Fairy Tale</h2><p>An insider&#39;s narrative of the creative process of the filmmaker best known for The Sixth Sense, told through his creation of the forthcoming movie, Lady in the Water, describes his writing practices, his on-location work with his cinematographer and crew, and his relationships with stars Paul Giamatti and Bryce Howard, in an account that also documents Shyamalan&#39;s difficult decision to change studios. 50,000 first printing.</p><p><b>MICHAEL BAMBERGER</b> is a senior writer for <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and the author of four books, including <i>Wonderland: A Year in the Life of an American High School</i> and <i>To the Linksland</i>.Sportswriter Bamberger's frothy though unconvincing account of the tentative making of Shyamalan's latest film, Lady in the Water, won't make a lasting contribution to film history but may appeal to diehard fans of the moviemaker who hit it big with The Sixth Sense. Bamberger meets his fellow Philadelphian Shyamalan and his wife, Bhavna, at a party in 2004, and becomes intrigued with how this Indian- British immigrant came up with the idea that allowed him to persuade all the right people to make his first movie, at age 28, which grossed $1 billion worldwide and earned six Oscar nominations. Bamberger explores the themes of faith and heresy that run through Shyamalan's movies, including Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, and the little-seen coming-of-age dramedy Wide Awake, and reveals Shyamalan's latest inspiration, his original fable about a sea nymph. Essentially, Bamberger follows the secretive moviemaker around and tries to get a sense of his thoughts: "Night was trying to write this ambitious, crazy, inspired screenplay, and a lot of the time he had no idea what he was doing." A soup-to-nuts account of the making of the movie evolves with plenty of flashy names from coast to coast, but the whole isn't all that nourishing.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

However, the instructions for making an Amish Quilt in a Day by Eleanor Burns are as high-tech as they come! Cutting is done with a rotary ctter and ruler with a bias line. Strip sewing instructions are written for the fast over lock as well as the conventional sewing machine. The Roman Stripe pattern in 10 different layouts is easy to follow! Described is a unique method of mitering the corners. Eleanor Burns has perfected a style of sewing that enables one to make a quilt in a day. The quilt is all straight lines and all that is needed is fabric, scissors, a rotary cutter and mat, a 6&#34; x 24&#34; ruler with 45 degree line and sewing machine with thread. The cutting is done all at once and then the next step is assembling and sewing the fabric strips together. She often ties the quilt to finish it rather than quilt it traditionally and than the entire quilt can be done in a day. The chapters take you through color selection, yardage charts, cutting charts, sewing the blocks (with shortcuts to make it faster), cutting the blocks, sewing the blocks together, sewing the borders and backing and finishing the quilt. This is an innovative way to make a quilt and for people with little time it is the perfect way to make a quilt that takes hours and not months!</p><p></p><h2>Mourning Dove: An Ella Clah Novel</h2><p>What seems to be a carjacking gone wrong leads to the death of Jimmy Blacksheep, a Navajo member of the New Mexico National Guard recently returned from Iraq. When Navajo Police Special Investigator Ella Clah receives a mysterious package in the mail, she begins to suspect that Jimmy's death is part of something larger. <br><br>Complicating the case is the fact that Jimmy's brother, Samuel Blacksheep, is also a cop, on the Farmington PD. Samuel is also ostensibly investigating Jimmy's death, but Ella wonders why Jimmy sent his secret message to her rather than his own brother. If Jimmy didn't trust Samuel, perhaps Ella shouldn't either. <br><br>When even the FBI's experts are unable to figure out the dead man's message, Ella realizes that she must use Navajo lore, not cryptography, to decode it. Tantalizing clues link Jimmy's death to his military service--but what could the medic have seen in Iraq that would make him a target for murder back home?<br><br>Ella's personal life seems just as complicated as her case. Her mother, Rose Destea, marries her long-time beau, Herman Cloud, and moves in with him. While Ella is delighted to see her mother happy, she cannot help but worry about making sure her daughter, Dawn, is safe and cared for at all times. Dawn's father asks for a change in custody arrangements that will reduce Ella to a weekend mother--a much easier fit with her workload but something that will take a terrible toll on her heart. <br><br></p><p>Aim�e and David Thurlo are the authors of the Ella Clah series, the Lee Nez series of Navajo vampire mysteries, and the Sister Agatha novels. Their other works include <i>Plant Them Deep</i>, a novel featuring Rose Destea, the mother of Ella Clah, and <i>The Spirit Line</i>, a young adult novel. <br>David was raised on the Navajo Reservation and taught school there until his recent retirement. Aim�e, a native of Cuba, has lived in the US for many years. They live in Corrales, New Mexico, and often make appearances at area bookstores. <br><br>Chapter One<br><br>In all her years serving first with the FBI, and then the Navajo Tribal Police, Special Investigator Ella Clah had never had an office with a window---until now. Of course, back in her Bureau days, she'd never even had an office---just a desk. Progress.<br><br>Budgets had grown, not due to tribal prosperity but because of an increase in violent crimes across the Navajo Nation. That had forced an expansion of their existing station and Ella, as head of their Major Crimes Unit, had landed space in their new wing. The odor of fresh paint was a constant reminder of the changes taking place in the department as was the color scheme, a palette of soft aquas, designed to relieve stress and maximize efficiency.<br><br>Ella swiveled in her chair, took a sip of freshly brewed coffee, and gazed at Ship Rock, the rock formation that was their town's namesake. In actuality, the jagged rock outcropping was the eroded neck of a volcano that had formed three million years ago.<br><br>Ella recalled the old story about the huge flying monsters that had once lived there. The tale was part of every Navajo child's education from before the first grade---that is, if they attended reservation schools. The story was vibrant with the richness and rhythms of the Dineh, The People's, legends. She could almost hear her mother, Rose, telling her the tale, keeping the legends alive---a gift from one generation to the next.<br><br>The Dineh had lived in fear of the giant birds who'd made their home on the upper levels of Ship Rock, Rose had taught her. The birds would swoop down and smash their prey against the rocks, then feed on the remains. Monster Slayer, one of the Hero Twins, was chosen to do battle with them, but when he approached their hunting ground, one of the giant birds picked him up in his talons, flew high into the skies, and dropped him, leaving him to fall on the rocks below. Expecting nothing less, Monster Slayer had prepared well and landed gently because he'd possessed a life feather given to him by Spider Woman.<br><br>Then Monster Slayer discovered that the giant birds had young and, after he killed the male and the female, the young began to cry and plead for their lives. Monster Slayer took pity on them and, instead of killing them, he turned the older one into an eagle so he could furnish feathers for men, and the younger one into an owl so men would listen to the owl's voice and be able to discern the future.<br><br>Rabbit, who was below, took some feathers from the giant bird Monster Slayer had killed and stuck them in his fur. And that's why jackrabbits have large ears that look like giant feathers.<br><br>All the Dinetah, the land of the Navajos, was filled with stories about the ones who'd come before. Every sandstone formation, pass or valley, mountain peak, and rock formation within the Four Corners and beyond echoed with the tradition of the Dineh.<br><br>Ella sipped her coffee. It was still early, and she refused to rush as she made up for all those years of staring at painted cinder blocks and file cabinets instead of the blue sky and drifting white clouds. The wind was calm now, as it usually was during the early morning hours, and she intended to savor this moment of peace. By noon, or maybe even before, the gusts could start again, blowing sand and dust everywhere.<br><br>Gathering her thoughts, she watched the crows hop around the parking lot outside, looking for crumbs and candy wrappers that still held a hint of flavor. Just beyond them she could see two support posts of a control gate built into the bank of the irrigation ditch. Last night some would-be comedian had slipped an old pair of khaki uniform pants onto the posts, then placed shoes on the ends. At first glance it looked like an officer was headfirst in the ditch. Everyone who'd driven past it on the way into the station had chuckled and commented about it, so it had remained in place for the moment. Later, the conservancy people would probably come by and return it to normal.<br><br>Finished with her coffee, she turned, hearing Justine step through the doorway. "Morning, partner," Ella greeted.<br><br>Justine nodded, a somber expression on her face. "Nothing's good about it now. Another possible carjacking went down late last night or earlier this morning. This time all hell has broken loose."<br><br>"What've we got?" Ella said, automatically reaching for her keys as she dropped the empty foam cup into the wastebasket.<br><br>"We've got a homicide too---a soldier who just returned home from Iraq. The officer at the scene ID'd him."<br><br>"How'd he die?" Ella grabbed her jacket, and was out the door before Justine had answered.<br><br>"Multiple gunshot wounds, according to the officer."<br><br>"Do you have a 'twenty' on this?" she asked referring to the location of the crime as they hurried down the hall.<br><br>"Just off Highway 64 about three miles west of Rattlesnake," Justine answered. "And we'll have to take your unit. Mine's getting new tires."<br><br>Once in the parking lot, they hurried to Ella's unmarked vehicle, Justine taking the keys. As they pulled up to the highway and Justine braked, checking for traffic, they both heard an ominous high-pitched squeal. "It's the dust from yesterday's wind. Smell it in the air? It's starting early today too. The breeze will turn into gusts before noon today for sure and sand will fly everywhere including the brake linings again," Ella said. "I read in the paper that the wind's been getting up to sixty in the afternoons. I hate this kind of weather. Waves and waves of sand, pitting the windshield, settling into the brake lines, even drifting into the gun barrels."<br><br>"Doesn't do much for your mood, does it, partner?" Justine observed with a wry smile.<br><br>"No, it doesn't. I can't stand the constant whistling through the slightest gap in the windows and doors, the sand blasting against your skin . . . not to mention evidence flying everywhere."<br><br>"Some say that Wind carries information. You just have to listen carefully," Justine said.<br><br>"Now you sound like my brother. Clifford knows all the stories. It's part of what makes him a good medicine man. He says that Wind has supporting power---that if I tune myself in to it, rather than become its adversary, I'd get farther. But I still hate the taste of sand in my mouth, and since Wind puts it there . . ."<br><br>Justine laughed.<br><br>Ella turned down the volume of the police radio. Today, it was mostly static and garbled transmissions. Another of Wind's side effects on obsolete equipment. The budget increases had targeted additional staff and facilities, not equipment, unfortunately. "What else did you get on this latest crime?"<br><br>"Officer Mark Lujan called it in just a few minutes before I came into your office," Justine answered. "He found the body down a side road near a cattle guard. It was visible from the highway. Most of the traffic this time of day goes toward town instead of away, so apparently nobody coming into work saw it across the road. Lujan was on his way west toward Beclabito."<br><br>Ella nodded. "I'm familiar with that stretch. It's pretty desolate out there past Rattlesnake. Just a few houses here and there down toward the river, and you really have to look for them. Most are earth-toned and they blend into the landscape, except for the generic red tar paper roofs."<br><br>They made a sweeping turn toward the northwest, and Ella looked up at Ute Mountain over in Colorado. "What do you have on the victim?"<br><br>"The deceased lived on land that was allotted to his family. After his parents passed on, he and his brother leased sections of it. The victim's name is Jimmy Blacksheep," she added after a moment's hesitation. Although police officers, by and large, were modernists, most of them shared a reluctance to speak of the recently deceased by name. It wasn't so much fear of the chindi, the evil in a man that stayed earthbound after death. It had more to do with respect for the Navajo cultural practices they'd learned and followed most of their lives. Habits of a lifetime were hard to break.<br><br>"Officer Lujan have any help at the scene?" Ella asked, staring at the lonely stretch of highway before them.<br><br>"No, but he's doing what he can to protect the crime scene until we arrive. Lujan's a rookie, but he's good. He'll handle things. And it's not like there's going to be a crowd there. Most of our people will go out of their way to avoid a body," Justine said then added. "Tache, Neskahi, and the M.E. should arrive at the scene shortly."<br><br>Ella nodded. Sergeant Joseph Neskahi and Officer Ralph Tache worked for her Special Investigations team and served as the Crime Scene Unit. Carolyn Roanhorse was a forensic pathologist, an M.D. who specialized in causes of death that related to court proceedings. Carolyn understood bullet trajectories, poisonings, and could differentiate between stab wounds and blunt injury ones. There were less than one thousand forensic pathologists in the country, but Carolyn worked exclusively for the tribe---an exception to the otherwise statewide authority of the N.M. Office of the Medical Investigators, headquartered in Albuquerque.<br><br>Carolyn had a thankless job. Since she worked with the bodies of the dead, she was virtually a pariah but, through her work, she continued to acknowledge her debt to the tribe who'd paid for her schooling.<br><br>As they approached the scene, Ella immediately spotted Officer Lujan standing ramrod straight in his tan uniform by the side of the road. He'd taken his post just outside the yellow crime-scene tape he'd used to cordon off the area around the body.<br><br>Officer Lujan was thin and lanky, unlike most Navajo males, and had large soulful eyes. Something about his posture, lack of expression, and the almost dogged determination not to look at the body behind him telegraphed far more than the officer realized.<br><br>"I bet you anything this is his first actual crime-scene body," Ella noted softly. "It's a toss-up what he wants to do more right now---puke or get into his cruiser and put some serious distance between him and this place. And, if my own experience is any guide, he's probably also wondering what other career choices he's overlooked."<br><br>They got out of the unit, and stepped over the yellow tape, which was flapping in the breeze. Office Lujan greeted them with a nod, but didn't say a word. Ella figured that he probably didn't trust his voice. She'd been there many times---when the need to erupt was kept just below the surface by sheer will. Even now, some crime scenes still had the power to get to her.<br><br>"Justine," Ella called out, "put out some cones. We're going to expand the yellow tape perimeter out to the center stripe of the highway. Officer Lujan can redirect traffic through the far lane. I'll call for another officer to assist."<br><br>One look at the faceup, bullet-riddled corpse in the gravel along the shoulder of the road suggested that the shooter might have fired from a vehicle. That meant at least one lane, maybe both, could contain vital evidence. If necessary, they'd close the road completely and stop traffic for as long as necessary.<br><br>She made the call with her cell phone, standing about fifteen feet from two obvious and separate pools of blood. The largest was beneath and around the victim, a fit-looking Navajo male with a buzz cut. He appeared to be in his early to mid-twenties and had a dozen or more bullet holes in his torso and legs. The entire area, a good one hundred feet in every direction from the body, could contain evidence. They'd also have to check for footprints leading away from the victim, in case there was another body farther from the road, still undiscovered.<br><br>"I know . . . knew . . . the deceased," the officer said, his voice taut, as if someone had grabbed him by the throat. He was staring at the ground before his feet, his eyes narrowed, a sign Ella recognized. Part of him was fighting to shut out the images he'd carry with him for the rest of his life.<br><br>"Do you have any idea who might have done this to him?" Ella asked. "A local enemy?" Soon Officer Lujan would learn to push back the screaming in his head. They all learned to do the job by getting past the insanity that shadowed their world.<br><br>Lujan shook his head. "I don't know anyone here who may have wanted him dead. All I know is that he's been serving overseas with a New Mexico National Guard transportation and supply unit. They had a welcome home ceremony about two weeks ago at Fort Bliss, then most of them spent several days waiting for their heavy equipment to arrive so they could drive it back to the armory in Farmington. They couldn't step down until then. He was due back yesterday," he said, then added, "His brother is a Farmington police officer. Should I call him?"<br><br>"Got a phone?" Ella asked, and Lujan nodded, reaching for a cell phone clipped to his Sam Browne belt. "Get the FPD duty officer, and have him or her relay the news."<br><br>While Lujan called the Farmington PD, Justine placed some bright orange cones some distance up and down the road from the scene. Once finished, she came back to the site and crouched down by a set of tire tracks, notebook in hand. "We don't have usable footprints, at least not in the vicinity of the body because of the gravel, and probably nowhere else as well. The wind's already starting to gust. I'll check farther from the road, of course. We don't have shell casings either, assuming the victim was shot and bled out here. But there's always the chance the shooter had a revolver, not an automatic."<br><br>"The rest of our crime scene team and the M.E. should be here by now. We need to expand our search," Ella muttered, checking her watch. "Where is everyone?"<br><br>Hearing traffic, Ella looked down the highway. "Never mind." A half minute later the tribe's medical examiner's vehicle pulled up, followed close behind by the even larger van used by the tribe's Crime Scene Unit. Ella nodded to Tache and Neskahi as they climbed out, then went to greet Carolyn Roanhorse, her longtime friend. As Carolyn walked, her baggy slacks and white medical jacket got whipped about by the wind, which had increased in intensity since Ella had first arrived on the scene.<br><br>Carolyn had always been a large woman, but she'd actually put on weight this past winter after her divorce. As she reached Officer Lujan, who was standing beside the yellow tape, she glared at him. "Large and in charge, and coming through. Get out of my way, son," she barked.<br><br>Carolyn stepped over the tape and went directly to the body, watching the ground for any obvious evidence in her path. "Some firefight," she said, crouching by the victim and looking closely at what appeared to be two blood trails. One led to the second pool Ella had noticed atop the asphalt. "Looks like he wasn't the only one who sprung a leak," she said.<br><br>"We'll photograph everything and take samples, but we still haven't got any shell casings or rounds, except what's probably in the victim's body," Ella said. "I'll need those slugs as soon as you can part with them. Also, I need an estimated time of death."<br><br>"Understood," Carolyn said, her eyes never leaving the corpse. "From the condition of the body, I'd say he died not more than a few hours ago---around seven in the morning, give or take. There are no obvious powder burns, so whatever happened here wasn't up close and personal." As she continued to study the body and the entry wounds in particular, she added, "Wait. Two shots were up close---execution style---so forget what I said before. Both went through his heart." Carolyn waited for Tache to take photos, then began the process of bagging the victim's hands.<br><br>Ella stepped away, letting Carolyn concentrate, and took in the scene.

Zinn, who had already been radicalized on the streets of Brooklyn as a teenager, got caught up along with his students (who included the future head of the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman, and author Alice Walker), and was kicked out in 1963 for "insubordination." He moved to Boston University, where he became an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War, and would prove a constant thorn in the side of university president John Silber throughout the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p> Zinn writes in plain language that brooks no nonsense when it speaks of moral urgency, but he isn't above a sense of humor. Noting that the FBI was watching him constantly during the war era, he wryly observes that, "I have grown to depend on them for accurate reports on my speeches." Individual scenes leap out at the reader: Zinn's horror when he realized, years after WWII, that he had dropped napalm bombs on German troops; a meeting in a college classroom with the sister and parents of one of the victims of the Kent State massacre; Selma, Alabama, police beating blacks attempting to register to vote while federal agents stand by and do nothing. Through it all, Zinn writes, "I see this as the central issue of our time: how to find a substitute for war in human ingenuity, imagination, courage, sacrifice, patience." <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Howard Zinn is professor of political science emeritus at Boston University.</p><h2>Tales of Ancient Egypt (Puffin Pixels)</h2><p><b>Embrace your inner geek with Puffin Pixels<br><br>Puffin Pixels </b>is a new collection of classics featuring pixelated, 8-bit video game cover artwork.

This work reveals and explains the vital connection between two epic battles:&nbsp;Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. <p>The staggering Confederate victories at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville are seldom treated as part of a coherent strategy, and they have never been presented as a single campaign. Yet, analyzed as a whole, the two battles go far to explain Lee&#x2019;s military success. At the same time, the failures and bungling that characterized Federal efforts are more intelligible when seen in the light of the political and military circumstances that thrust unprepared and inadequate Union commanders into predicaments they little understood. The eastern theater in the winter of 1862 and spring of 1863 witnessed sudden shifts in northern command and strategy and increasing political intervention. Lincoln despaired of McClellan and sought a general more willing to fight; whatever the ultimate result of this search, it provided opportunities the canny Lee was willing and able to exploit.</p></p><p>Daniel E. Sutherland is a professor of history at the University of Arkansas. His books include <i>The Confederate Carpetbaggers</i> and the award-winning <i>Seasons of War: The Ordeal of a Confederate Community, 1861&#x2013;1865</i>.A broadly researched, finely detailed, and well-written analysis of the connections linking two pivotal battles in the early part of the Civil War, by Sutherland (Seasons of War; 1995, etc.). The author pairs the battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, which took place on the southern side of the Rapohanock River in Virginia, and refers to them jointly as the ``Dare Mark'' campaign. (A Confederate soldier referred to the Rapohanock as the dare mark because Union armies dared not cross the river.) Sutherland combines minute strategic scrutiny with a deep knowledge of the personalities involvednotably, Lee and Jackson for the South, and Halleck, Burnside, and Hooker for the North. And he consults a broad range of sources, ranging from soldiers letters and contemporary newspaper accounts to postwar memoirs. Thus armed, Sutherland is able to place the battles in their broadest political and military contexts. Both battles led to Southern victories, and he examines their consequences, including the accidental death of Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson in his own troops crossfire, Lees inability to smash Hookers army, and Lees drive northward after his victory at Chancellorsville. Much attention is paid to the wars mismanagement by Congress and by various Northern officers and to fascinating partisan efforts to control the Union military. Sutherland, a professor of history at the University of Arkansas, is a deft writer. He identifies the facets of battle (and surrounding events) in a coherent fashion that will allow readers to peer over his shoulder at the larger picture. Though far too detailed in its dealings with military strategy and, this is nonetheless worthy of War-Between-the-States diehards.

And it was watching.<br><br>&#x201c;It is, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br>The playground was full of children, their gray uniforms flapping as they ran and kicked balls into makeshift goals. Amid the shouting and the games, a few girls were watching the fox.<br><br>&#x201c;It definitely is. It&#x2019;s just watching us,&#x201d; a tall blond girl said. She could see the animal clearly behind a fringe of grass and thistle. &#x201c;Why isn&#x2019;t it moving?&#x201d; She walked slowly towards it.<br>At first the friends had thought the animal was a dog, and had started ambling towards it while they chatted. But halfway across the tarmac they had realized it was a fox.<br><br>It was a cold cloudless autumn morning and the sun was bright. None of them could quite believe what they were seeing. The fox kept standing still as they approached.<br><br>&#x201c;I saw one once before,&#x201d; whispered Kath, shifting her bag from shoulder to shoulder. &#x201c;I was with my dad by the canal. He told me there&#x2019;s loads in London now, but you don&#x2019;t normally see them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It should be running,&#x201d; said Keisha, anxiously. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying here. That&#x2019;s got teeth.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All the better to eat you with,&#x201d; said Deeba.<br><br>&#x201c;That was a wolf,&#x201d; said Kath.<br><br>Kath and Keisha held back: Zanna, the blond girl, slowly approached the fox, with Deeba, as usual, by her side. They got closer, expecting it to arch into one of those beautiful curves of animal panic, and duck under the fence. It kept not doing so.<br><br>The girls had never seen any animal so still. It wasn&#x2019;t that it wasn&#x2019;t moving: it was furiously not-moving. By the time they got close to the climbing frame they were creeping exaggeratedly, like cartoon hunters.<br><br>The fox eyed Zanna&#x2019;s outstretched hand politely. Deeba frowned.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, it is watching,&#x201d; Deeba said. &#x201c;But not us. It&#x2019;s watching you.&#x201d;<br>Zanna&#x2014;she hated her name Susanna, and she hated &#x201c;Sue&#x201d; even more&#x2014;had moved to the estate about a year ago, and quickly made friends with Kath and Keisha and Becks and others. Especially Deeba. On her way to Kilburn Comprehensive, on her first day, Deeba had made Zanna laugh, which not many people could do. Since then, where Zanna was, Deeba tended to be too. There was something about Zanna that drew attention. She was decent-to-good at things like sports, schoolwork, dancing, whatever, but that wasn&#x2019;t it: she did well enough to do well, but never enough to stand out. She was tall and striking, but she never played that up either: if anything, she seemed to try to stay in the background. But she never quite could. If she hadn&#x2019;t been easy to get on with, that could have caused her trouble.<br><br>Sometimes even her mates were a little bit wary of Zanna, as if they weren&#x2019;t quite sure how to deal with her. Even Deeba herself had to admit that Zanna could be a bit dreamy. Sometimes she would sort of zone out, staring skywards or losing the thread of what she was saying.<br><br>Just at that moment, however, she was concentrating hard on what Deeba had just said.<br>Zanna put her hands on her hips, and even her sudden movement didn&#x2019;t make the fox jump.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; said Deeba. &#x201c;It hasn&#x2019;t taken its eyes off you.&#x201d;<br><br>Zanna met the fox&#x2019;s gentle vulpine gaze. All the girls watching, and the animal, seemed to get lost in something.<br><br>. . . Until their attention was interrupted by the bell for the end of break. The girls looked at each other, blinking.<br><br>The fox finally moved. Still looking at Zanna, it bowed its head. It did it once, then leapt up and was gone.<br><br>Deeba watched Zanna, and muttered, &#x201c;This is just getting weird.&#x201d;</p><h2>Do Butlers Burgle Banks</h2><p>Do Butlers Burgle Banks? features the hither to fortunate owner of Bond&#x2019;s Bank, who find himself in a spot of trouble so serious that he wants someone to burgle the bank before the trustees inspect it.

For Horace is, in fact, not a butler at all but the best sort of gangster, prudently concealing himself in an English country house while hiding from his rivals.

Restless and unchallenged, he turned to ballooning, a lifelong passion as well as a constant diversion for his imagination during his imprisonment. His primary goal was a solitary circumnavigation of the globe, and in its pursuit he set several ballooning distance records, including the first solo crossing of the Atlantic in 1984. But the aeronautical feats that first made him an American hero had occurred a quarter of a century earlier.</p><p>By the time Kittinger was shot down in Vietnam in 1972, his Air Force career was already legendary. He had made a name for himself at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamogordo, New Mexico, as a test pilot who helped demonstrate that egress survival for pilots at high altitudes was possible in emergency situations. Ironically, Kittinger and his pre-astronaut colleagues would help propel Americans into space using the world's oldest flying machine--the balloon. Kittinger's work on Project Excelsior--which involved daring high-altitude bailout tests--earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross long before he earned a collection of medals in Vietnam. Despite the many accolades, Kittinger's proudest moment remains his free fall from 102,800 feet during which he achieved a speed of 614 miles per hour.</p><br><p>In this long-awaited autobiography, Kittinger joins author Craig Ryan to document an astonishing career.</p><br><p><b>Selected by <i>Popular Mechanics</i> as a Top Book of 2010</b></p></p><p>Kittinger, joined by author Craig Ryan, documents the heights of his extraordinary aeronautical career.Craig Ryan is the author of <i>Magnificent Failure: Free Fall from the Edge of Space and The Pre-Astronauts: Manned Ballooning on the Threshold of Space</i>.

The Self-Sustaining Garden advocates using plants as partners in self-sustaining communities to create low maintenance gardens rather than being a slave to spades and hoes. In a series of compelling case studies, Peter Thompson shows how to transform a conventional garden into a self-sustaining garden. Updated from the original edition (published in 1997), The Self-Sustaining Garden brings together an explanation of the universal principles of matrix planting with specific applications and informative chapters on soil health and biological controls, and shows how to pull all the ingredients together into a strong, self-sustaining design.</p><p>Matrix planting matches plants and places, and combines appropriate plants in communities to create a low-maintenance, naturalistic garden.Peter Thompson, Ph.D., has been the Sydney Mayer Lecturer in Early American History at Oxford University since January 1993.

His most recent books are <i>William Styron: A Life</i> (1998) and <i>The Perfect Hour: The Romance of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ginevra King</i> (2005).Focusing on Jennie Gerhardt, a poor young girl in Columbus, Ohio, Theodore Dreiser&#39;s novel depicts her inadvertently defying a host of conventions-of class, gender, family, and religion. Over a quarter of a century she is repeatedly victimized by circumstance, temperament, and most particularly the fact of her sex. Yet the triumph of the book lies in her incorrigibly loving nature. Cast out by society as well as by her family, she none the less fosters a far deeper understanding of relationships than anyone else. It is no surprise that she was her author&#39;s favourite heroine.</p><h2>Take Good Care: Finding Your Joy in Compassionate Caregiving</h2><p><b>In a time when tens of millions of people provide care for family members, older adults, and people with special needs, we should all be experts at it.

And yet, as we discover during one day in the life of Mr. Blank, his world is not so different from our own.</p><p>Paul Auster is the bestselling author of twelve previous novels, including <i>The Brooklyn Follies</i>, <i>Oracle Night</i>, <i>The Book of Illusions</i>, and <i>Timbuktu</i>. His work has been translated into more than thirty languages. He lives in Brooklyn.Excerpt<br>&nbsp;<br>The old man sits on the edge of the narrow bed, palms spread out on his knees, head down, staring at the floor. He has no idea that a camera is planted in the ceiling directly above him. The shutter clicks silently once every second, producing eighty-six thousand four hundred still photos with each revolution of the earth. Even if he knew he was being watched, it wouldn't make any difference. His mind is elsewhere, stranded among the figments in his head as he searches for an answer to the question that haunts him.<br>&nbsp;<br>Who is he? What is he doing here? When did he arrive and how long will he remain? With any luck, time will tell us all. For the moment, our only task is to study the pictures as attentively as we can and refrain from drawing any premature conclusions.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are a number of objects in the room, and on each one a strip of white tape has been affixed to the surface, bearing a single word written out in block letters. On the bedside table, for example, the word is table. On the lamp, the word is lamp. Even on the wall, which is not strictly speaking an object, there is a strip of tape that reads wall. The old man looks up for a moment, sees the wall, sees the strip of tape attached to the wall, and pronounces the word wall in a soft voice. What cannot be known at this point is whether he is reading the word on the strip of tape or simply referring to the wall itself. It could be that he has forgotten how to read but still recognizes things for what they are and can call them by their names, or, conversely, that he has lost the ability to recognize things for what they are but still knows how to read.<br>&nbsp;<br>He is dressed in blue-and-yellow striped cotton pajamas, and his feet are encased in a pair of black leather slippers. It is unclear to him exactly where he is. In the room, yes, but in what building is the room located? In a house? In a hospital? In a prison? He can't remember how long he has been here or the nature of the circumstances that precipitated his removal to this place. Perhaps he has always been here; perhaps this is where he has lived since the day he was born. What he knows is that his heart is filled with an implacable sense of guilt. At the same time, he can't escape the feeling that he is the victim of a terrible injustice.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is one window in the room, but the shade is drawn, and as far as he can remember he has not yet looked out of it. Likewise with the door and its white porcelain knob. Is he locked in, or is he free to come and go as he wishes? He has yet to investigate this matter--for, as stated in the first paragraph above, his mind is elsewhere, adrift in the past as he wanders among the phantom beings that clutter his head, struggling to answer the question that haunts him.<br>&nbsp;<br>The pictures do not lie, but neither do they tell the whole story. They are merely a record of time passing, the outward evidence. The old man's age, for example, is difficult to determine from the slightly out-of-focus black-and-white images. The only fact that can be set down with any certainty is that he is not young, but the word old is a flexible term and can be used to describe a person anywhere between sixty and a hundred. We will therefore drop the epithet old man and henceforth refer to the person in the room as Mr. Blank. For the time being, no first name will be necessary.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Blank stands up from the bed at last, pauses briefly to steady his balance, and then shuffles over to the desk at the other end of the room. He feels tired, as if he has just woken from a fitful, too short night of sleep, and as the soles of his slippers scrape along the bare wood floor, he is reminded of the sound of sandpaper. Far off in the distance, beyond the room, beyond the building in which the room is located, he hears the faint cry of a bird--perhaps a crow, perhaps a seagull, he can't tell which.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Blank lowers his body into the chair at the desk. It is an exceedingly comfortable chair, he decides, made of soft brown leather and equipped with broad armrests to accommodate his elbows and forearms, not to speak of an invisible spring mechanism that allows him to rock back and forth at will, which is precisely what he begins to do the moment he sits down. Rocking back and forth has a soothing effect on him, and as Mr. Blank continues to indulge in these pleasurable oscillations, he remembers the rocking horse that sat in his bedroom when he was a small boy, and then he begins to relive some of the imaginary journeys he used to take on that horse, whose name was Whitey and who, in the young Mr. Blank's mind, was not a wooden object adorned with white paint but a living being, a true horse.<br>&nbsp;<br>After this brief excursion into his early boyhood, anguish rises up into Mr. Blank's throat again. He says out loud in a weary voice: I mustn't allow this to happen. Then he leans forward to examine the piles of papers and photographs stacked neatly on the surface of the mahogany desk. He takes hold of the pictures first, three dozen eight-by-ten black-and-white portraits of men and women of various ages and races. The photo on top shows a young woman in her early twenties. Her dark hair is cropped short, and there is an intense, troubled look in her eyes as she gazes into the lens. She is standing outdoors in some city, perhaps an Italian or French city, because she happens to be positioned in front of a medieval church, and because the woman is wearing a scarf and a woolen coat, it is safe to assume the picture was taken in winter. Mr. Blank stares into the eyes of the young woman and strains to remember who she is. After twenty seconds or so, he hears himself whisper a single word: Anna. A feeling of overpowering love washes through him. He wonders if Anna isn't someone he was once married to, or if, perhaps, he isn't looking at a picture of his daughter. An instant after thinking these thoughts, he is attacked by a fresh wave of guilt, and he knows that Anna is dead. Even worse, he suspects that he is responsible for her death. It might even be, he tells himself, that he was the person who killed her.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Blank groans in pain. Looking at the pictures is too much for him, so he pushes them aside and turns his attention to the papers. There are four piles in all, each about six inches high. For no particular reason that he is aware of, he reaches for the top page on the pile farthest to the left. The handwritten words, printed out in block letters similar to the ones on the strips of white tape, read as follows:<br>&nbsp;<br>Viewed from the outermost reaches of space, the earth is no larger than a speck of dust. Remember that the next time you write the word "humanity."<br>&nbsp;<br>From the look of disgust that comes over his face as he scans these sentences, we can be fairly confident that Mr. Blank has not lost the ability to read. But who the author of these sentences might be is still open to question.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Blank reaches out for the next page on the pile and discovers that it is a typed manuscript of some sort. The first paragraph reads:<br>&nbsp;<br>The moment I started to tell my story, they knocked me down and kicked me in the head. When I climbed to my feet and started to talk again, one of them hit me across the mouth, and then another one punched me in the stomach. I fell down. I managed to get up again, but just as I was about to begin the story for the third time, the Colonel threw me against the wall and I passed out.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are two more paragraphs on the page, but before Mr. Blank can begin reading the second one, the telephone rings. It is a black rotary model from the late forties or early fifties of the past century, and since it is located on the bedside table, Mr. Blank is forced to stand up from the soft leather chair and shuffle over to the other side of the room. He picks up the receiver on the fourth ring.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hello, says Mr. Blank.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mr. Blank? asks the voice on the other end.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you say so.<br>&nbsp;<br>Are you sure? I can't take any chances.<br>&nbsp;<br>I'm not sure of anything. If you want to call me Mr. Blank, I'm happy to answer to that name. Who am I talking to?<br>&nbsp;<br>James.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don't know any James.<br>&nbsp;<br>James P. Flood.<br>&nbsp;<br>Refresh my memory.<br>&nbsp;<br>I came to visit you yesterday. We spent two hours together.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ah. The policeman.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ex-policeman.<br>&nbsp;<br>Right. The ex-policeman. What can I do for you?<br>&nbsp;<br>I want to see you again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Wasn't one conversation enough?<br>&nbsp;<br>Not really. I know I'm just a minor character in this business, but they said I was allowed to see you twice.<br>&nbsp;<br>You're telling me I have no choice.<br>&nbsp;<br>I'm afraid so. But we don't have to talk in the room if you don't want to. We can go out and sit in the park if you'd prefer that.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don't have anything to wear. I'm standing here dressed in pajamas and slippers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Look in the closet. You have all the clothes you need.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ah. The closet. Thank you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Have you had your breakfast, Mr. Blank?<br>&nbsp;<br>I don't think so. Am I allowed to eat?<br>&nbsp;<br>Three meals a day. It's still a bit early, but Anna should be coming around pretty soon.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anna? Did you say Anna?<br>&nbsp;<br>She's the person who takes care of you.<br>&nbsp;<br>I thought she was dead.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hardly.<br>&nbsp;<br>Maybe it's a different Anna.<br>&nbsp;<br>I doubt it. Of all the people involved in this story, she's the only one who's completely on your side.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the others?<br>&nbsp;<br>Let's just say there's a lot of resentment, and we'll leave it at that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2007 by Paul Auster.

Aiming to rethink the form of modern life, the Bauhaus became the site of a dazzling array of experiments in the visual arts that have profoundly shaped the world today. <i>Bauhaus 1919-1933: Workshops for Modernity</i>, published to accompany a major multimedia exhibition, is The Museum of Modern Art's first comprehensive treatment of the subject since its famous Bauhaus exhibition of 1938, and offers a new generational perspective on the twentieth century's most influential experiment in artistic education. Organized in collaboration with the three major Bauhaus collections in Germany (the Bauhaus-Archiv Berlin, the Stiftung Bauhaus Dessau and the Klassic Stiftung Weimar), <i>Bauhaus 1919-1933</i> examines the extraordinarily broad spectrum of the school's products, including industrial design, furniture, architecture, graphics, photography, textiles, ceramics, theater and costume design, painting and sculpture. Many of the objects discussed and illustrated here have rarely if ever been seen or published outside Germany. Featuring approximately 400 color plates, richly complemented by documentary images, <i>Bauhaus 1919-1933</i> includes two overarching essays by the exhibition's curators, Barry Bergdoll and Leah Dickerman, that present new perspectives on the Bauhaus. Shorter essays by more than 20 leading scholars apply contemporary viewpoints to 30 key Bauhaus objects, and an illustrated narrative chronology provides a dynamic glimpse of the Bauhaus' lived history.</p><p>a thoroughly impressive catalogue of works.... The development of the Bauhaus was eclectic in both concept and deed, and the sheer variety of works in 'Workshops for Modernity' deftly illustrates that fact.

Before Sylvia makes her final decision, smoldering racial tension in the town ignites into flame. When the smoke clears, she sees clearly that nothing is going to stop the change from coming. It is up to her generation to make it happen, in as many different ways as there are colors in the world.</p><p>Sharon M. Draper is the coauthor of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>We Beat the Street</i> and the author of many other books for young readers. She lives in Cincinnati, Ohio.Draper neatly intertwines history, pop culture, and emotion as she explores the turbulent era of Civil Rights through the eyes of an African-American teen. The year is 1957 and Sylvia Faye is chosen to be one of the first black students to enter Central High School in the racially charged town of Little Rock, AR, where the owner of the barbershop has &#x201c;trained his dogs to attack Negroes.&#x201d; She is excited and honored but also very scared. She worries about her older brother who challenges whites with his fists instead of following her noble example by excelling in school and walking away from trouble. Sylvia Faye&#x2019;s character is very real and appealing, and the frank dialogue is both educational and refreshing. The text alternates between third-person narrative and Sylvia Faye&#x2019;s journal entries, allowing readers to experience her thoughts and fears about the important decision she must make. The author&#x2019;s ability to explore numerous prejudices subtly without bogging down readers with too much backstory is impressive, and she effectively shows the enormity of the decision and the tenor of the times. &#x2014;<i>School Library Journal</i></p><h2>Slither</h2><p>1st Hamlyn 1980 edition 1st printing paperback, vg++ In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p></p><h2>Growing &amp; Using the Healing Herbs</h2><p>Collectible.

Madsen offers a rich and compelling look at this fascinating and influential woman, the first living female artist to have a retrospective show at the Louvre.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><p>Axel Madsen authored twenty-two books, including sixteen biographies. His most notable works include an in-depth look at the life of a legendary fashion icon,&nbsp;<i>Chanel: A Woman of Her Own</i>, and an investigation of the relationship between Gloria Swanson and Joe Kennedy,&nbsp;<i>Gloria and Joe: The Star-Crossed Love Affair of Gloria Swanson and Joe Kennedy</i>. Madsen began his journalism career as a legman for columnist Art Buchwald in Paris, and later wrote one of the first books on television&#x2019;s longest-running news magazine show,&nbsp;<i>60 Minutes: The Power and the Politics of America&#x2019;s Most Popular TV News Show</i>. As a 20th Century Fox publicist, he handled Robert Redford, Paul Newman, and George C. Scott, and was fired off&nbsp;<i>Myra Breckinridge</i>&nbsp;for siding with director Mike Sarne against producer Robert Fryer. His Hollywood biographies include the life stories of directors William Wyler, John Huston, and Barbara Stanwyck, as well as an examination of Golden Age Hollywood&#x2019;s gay underground in&nbsp;<i>The Sewing Circle</i>. He wrote and produced the ITV documentary version of&nbsp;<i>The Sewing Circle</i>. Over the years, Madsen interviewed scores of movers and shakers, from legends like Goldwyn and Selznick to directors like Howard Hawks, Louis Milestone, and Rouben Mamoulian. Madsen died in 2007.Russian-born Delaunay (1885-1979), nee Stein, a pioneer of modernism in the Paris of Picasso and Matisse, commands attention as an artist and a feminist by example (if not in word or posture). Her radiant canvases, with their sun-like disks of swirling color, brought a warmth to cubism missing in the work of Braque or Gris. After the Bolsheviks confiscated her adoptive uncle's wealth during the Russian Revolution, Delaunay, already in Paris, was forced to earn a living. Her abstract textiles and graphics, and the jazz-age clothing she designed, helped define art deco. For decades, this expatriate supported herself, her son and husband, French cubist painter Robert Delaunay, portrayed here as a hopelessly impractical enfant terrible. At age 67, after restoring her late husband's eclipsed reputation, she broke out of his orbit to experiment with form and color. In this gossipy, wonderfully evocative biography, Madsen, biographer of Malraux and Sartre, juggles an astonishing cast of luminaries as he re-creates the bohemian artistic-literary circles of Paris.

A Duty-dance with Death</h2><p><b>Slaughterhous-Five</b> is one of the world's great anti-war books. Centering on the infamous fire-bombing of Dresden, Billy Pilgrim's odyssey through time reflects the mythic journey of our own fractured lives as we search for meaning in what we are afraid to know.</p><p>Kurt Vonnegut's absurdist classic <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> introduces us to Billy Pilgrim, a man who becomes unstuck in time after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. In a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity, we follow Pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life, concentrating on his (and Vonnegut's) shattering experience as an American prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of Dresden. <p> Don't let the ease of reading fool you--Vonnegut's isn't a conventional, or simple, novel. He writes, "There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters..." <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> (taken from the name of the building where the POWs were held) is not only Vonnegut's most powerful book, it is as important as any written since 1945. Like <i>Catch- 22</i>, it fashions the author's experiences in the Second World War into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority. <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> boasts the same imagination, humanity, and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in Vonnegut's other works, but the book's basis in rock-hard, tragic fact gives it a unique poignancy--and humor.</p>Kurt Vonnegut was a master of contemporary American literature. His black humor, satiric voice, and incomparable imagination first captured America's attention in <b>The Sirens of Titan </b>in 1959 and established him as "a true artist" with <b>Cat's Cradle</b> in 1963. He was, as Graham Greene declared, "one of the best living American writers.&#x201d; Mr. Vonnegut passed away in April 2007.</p><h2>The Experiment (Nightmare Hall No. 8)</h2><p>Caryl Amberly is thrilled when she is selected to participate in Professor Maximillian Delure&#39;s new seminar until she learns of his reputation as a scientist, poet--and killer.

The book s title captures two of its central tenets. First, that writing effectively is a matter of making particular moves in response to dynamic contexts rather than applying static templates. And second, that writing itself moves, circulating through contexts and changing shape along the way. With chapters organized around inquiry-based prompts, students engage in an ongoing investigation into the new literacies emerging in and being shaped by the digital practices of various private, public, and academic contexts. Through that investigation students learn and continue to practice the skills of observing new contexts and conversations and deciding from those observations how to successfully communicate in them. Writing Moves constitutes a sustained inquiry into what it means to become a writer who is rhetorically aware and who can deploy a variety of strategies to compose effectively in the print and digital contexts of the twenty-first century.</p><p></p><h2>Bison Producers&#39; Handbook</h2><p>This comprehensive book is packed with information for veteran bison producers and newcomers alike.

The first of two winning entries (the other will be published in fall 2013 as PA 34) was submitted by Luis Callejas of LCLA Office in Medellin, Colombia. <em>Pamphlet Architecture 33: Islands and Atolls</em> asks how architecture might critically repurpose its traditionally limited disciplinary tools in order to make a meaningful impact at a territorial scale. Functioning as a landscape architect in a country that has no infrastructure for such a profession, Callejas questions pedagogical, disciplinary, and political norms at macro levels using micro tactics. As a result, <em>PA 33</em> provocatively expands devices such as repetition and aggregation beyond their limits in scenarios where sociopolitical constraints seemingly prohibit what would normally be understood as an architectural intervention.</p><p>To be announced</p><h2>All the Things You Are: Transcriptions and In-Depth Analysis of Solos by 15 Jazz Greats Playing Jerome Kern&#39;s Classic Song (Hal Leonard Piano Signature Songs)</h2><p>(Signature Songs).

Sixty-five species of Aquilegia receive detailed examination, with a complete summary of cultivation needs, history, and biology. The author also describes plants of the genera Semiaquilegia and Paraquilegia, cutting through confusion and dissension to create a useful overview of these &#34;columbine cousins.&#34; Nold also provides a brief history of hybridization, and practical chapters on propagation and pests and diseases round out the book.

Now, the latter threatens to overcome the former, as she strives to prevent the events which are dependent on the decisions Lyra is fated to make. Meanwhile, Will - scarred and traumatised after his last, fatal meeting with his father-seeks blindly for her, with only two of Lord Asriel&#39;s angels as companions on his dangerous search. The two are fated to meet once more, however, and begin their most treacherous journey. For Lyra owes a great debt, and she must repay it - she must rescue her friend from the Land of the Dead. Neither are prepared for the terrible sacrifice they must endure, or for the universal consequences of their actions. Lyra and Will must play their part in the war between the worlds and Heaven...</p><p>From the very start of its very first scene, <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> will set hearts fluttering and minds racing. All we'll say here is that we immediately discover who captured Lyra at the end of <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, though we've yet to discern whether this individual's intent is good, evil, or somewhere in between. We also learn that Will still possesses the blade that allows him to cut between worlds, and has been joined by two winged companions who are determined to escort him to Lord Asriel's mountain redoubt. The boy, however, has only one goal in mind--to rescue his friend and return to her the alethiometer, an instrument that has revealed so much to her and to readers of <i>The Golden Compass</i> and its follow-up. Within a short time, too, we get to experience the "tingle of the starlight" on Serafina Pekkala's skin as she seeks out a famished Iorek Byrnison and enlists him in Lord Asriel's crusade: <blockquote> A complex web of thoughts was weaving itself in the bear king's mind, with more strands in it than hunger and satisfaction. There was the memory of the little girl Lyra, whom he had named Silvertongue, and whom he had last seen crossing the fragile snow bridge across a crevasse in his own island of Svalbard. Then there was the agitation among the witches, the rumors of pacts and alliances and war; and then there was the surpassingly strange fact of this new world itself, and the witch's insistence that there were many more such worlds, and that the fate of them all hung somehow on the fate of the child. </blockquote> Meanwhile, two factions of the Church are vying to reach Lyra first. One is even prepared to give a priest "preemptive absolution" should he succeed in committing mortal sin. For these tyrants, killing this girl is no less than "a sacred task." <p> In the final installment of his trilogy, Philip Pullman has set himself the highest hurdles. He must match its predecessors in terms of sheer action and originality <i>and</i> resolve the enigmas he already created. The good news is that there is no critical bad news--not that <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> doesn't contain standoffs and close calls galore. (Who would have it otherwise?) But Pullman brings his audacious revision of <i>Paradise Lost</i> to a conclusion that is both serene and devastating. In prose that is transparent yet lyrical and 3-D, the author weaves in and out of his principals' thoughts. He also offers up several additional worlds. In one, Dr. Mary Malone is welcomed into an apparently simple society. The environment of the <i>mulefa</i> (again, we'll reveal nothing more) makes them rich in consciousness while their lives possess a slow and stately rhythm. These strange creatures can, however, be very fast on their feet (or on other things entirely) when necessary. Alas, they are on the verge of dying as Dust streams out of their idyllic landscape. Will the Oxford dark-matter researcher see her way to saving them, or does this require our young heroes? And while Mary is puzzling out a cure, Will and Lyra undertake a pilgrimage to a realm devoid of all light and hope, after having been forced into the cruelest of sacrifices--or betrayals. </p><p> Throughout his galvanizing epic, Pullman sustains scenes of fierce beauty and tenderness. He also allows us a moment or two of comic respite. At one point, for instance, Lyra's mother bullies a series of ecclesiastical underlings: "The man bowed helplessly and led her away. The guard behind her blew out his cheeks with relief." Needless to say, Mrs. Coulter is as intoxicating and fluid as ever. And can it be that we will come to admire her as she plays out her desperate endgame? In this respect, as in many others, <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> is truly a book of revelations, moving from darkness visible to radiant truth. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"The Amber Spyglass brings the intrigue of "The Golden Compass and "The Subtle Knife to a heart-stopping end, marking the final volume of His Dark Materials as the most powerful of the trilogy. <br>Along with the return of Lyra, Will, Mrs. Coulter, Lord Asriel, Dr. Mary Malone, and Iorek Byrnison the armored bear, come a host of new characters: the Mulefa, mysterious wheeled creatures with the power to see Dust; Gallivespian Lord Roke, a hand-high spymaster to Lord Asriel; and Metatron, a fierce and mighty angel. So, too, come startling revelations: the painful price Lyra must pay to walk through the land of the dead, the haunting power of Dr. Malone's amber spyglass, and the names of who will live--and who will die--for love. And all the while, war rages with the Kingdom of Heaven, a brutal battle that--in its shocking outcome--will uncover the secret of Dust.

The authors show that George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev maintained an unusually close, confidential relationship, beginning with their shipboard meeting in Malta in December 1989 and extending through 1991. Relying on secret understandings reached in consultation with only their very closest advisers, the two leaders developed what they dubbed a "partnership" that helped transform East-West rivalry into cooperation. Bush, by this account, coaxed the Soviet Union to end the Cold War by convincing Gorbachev that the West would not exploit its vulnerability. Beschloss ( Kennedy and Roosevelt ) and Time foreign affairs correspondent Talbott ( Deadly Gambits ) disclose that Bush cajoled Gorbachev to agree to a reunified Germany's membership in NATO; that former Secretary of State James Baker frantically attempted to warn Gorbachev of the right-wing coup against him. The authors also reveal details of the unprecedented collaboration between Moscow and Washington in the Persian Gulf war, by which Soviet emissaries quietly conveyed Baker's demands to the Iraqi regime. When Russian troops massacred Baltic protesters in Riga and Vilnius, Bush wrote Gorbachev a private letter threatening to cut off all economic assistance, the authors maintain. This highly personal statecraft had its downside for both leaders, assert the authors: Gorbachev, basking in Bush's support, adopted a complacent attitude toward his rival Boris Yeltsin and grossly underestimated the Soviet people's discontent. And Bush was so intent on shoring up Gorbachev that he was slow to perceive that by mid-1991 the Soviet leader was largely a spent force. Critics no doubt will attack this expose since its authors, while using dozens of named sources, also use a raft of unnamed high-level informants from Washington, Moscow and Europe. Their research notes and interview records are under time-seal at the Williams College library in Massachusetts for use by future scholars. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Authors separately of several books on foreign affairs, journalists Beschloss and Talbott have collaborated on a fascinating insider's account of the various negotiations between George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev from 1989 to 1991. At the outset, the authors indicate that they will not reveal many of their sources, although they have placed their notes under time seal at the Williams College Library for the use of future scholars. Thus, in the fashion of All the President's Men ( LJ 5/15/74), the book offers remarkable accounts of meetings and conversations--at which sometimes only Bush, Gorbachev, and the interpreters were in attendance--with no sources cited; the reader must simply trust the veracity of the authors. Of particular interest is their account of how the Bush administration came to grips with Gorbachev's vastly different style, seeking to work with him while not appearing soft on communism.

In the first millennium, when a majority of people were unable to read for themselves, lectio divina involved hearing passages from the Bible during church services or sometimes being given a word or phrase by a spiritual mentor. Pennington, a Trappist monk and author of books on centering prayer, monastic life, and Thomas Merton, emphasizes the experiential aspects of the practice, noting that the intent is not to study Bible passages for knowledge but to deepen awareness of God's presence.

In December of 1972, a pair of musicians placed an advertisement in the <i>Village Voice</i>: &#x201c;GUITARIST WANTED WITH FLASH AND ABILITY.&#x201d; Ace Frehley figured he had both, so he answered the ad. The rest is rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll history.<br><br>He was just a boy from the Bronx with stars in his eyes. But when he picked up his guitar and painted stars on his face, Ace Frehley transformed into &#x201c;The Spaceman&#x201d;&#x2014;and helped turn KISS into one of the top-selling bands in the world. Now, for the first time, the beloved rock icon reveals his side of the story with no-holds-barred honesty . . . and no regrets.<br><br>For KISS fans, Ace offers a rare behind-the-makeup look at the band&#x2019;s legendary origins, including the lightning-bolt logo he designed and the outfits his mother sewed.

Along the way, he shares wild stories about dancing at Studio 54 with &#x201c;The Bionic Woman,&#x201d; working as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix, and bar-flying all night with John Belushi.

Carl Frehley was a man of his times. He worked long hours, multiple jobs, did the best he could to provide a home for his wife and kids. Sometimes, on Sunday afternoons after church, he&#x2019;d pile the whole family into a car and we&#x2019;d drive north through the Bronx, into Westchester County, and eventually find ourselves on the banks of the Hudson River. Dad would take us on a tour of the West Point campus and grounds, introduce us to people, even take us into the control room of the electrical plant. I&#x2019;m still not sure how he pulled that one off&#x2014;getting security clearance for his whole family&#x2014;but he did.<br> <br>Dad would walk around, pointing out various sights, explaining the rhythm of his day and the work that he did, sometimes talking in the language of an engineer, a language that might as well have been Latin to me. Work was important, and I guess in some way he just wanted his kids to understand that; he wanted us to see this other part of his life.<br> <br>One day, as we headed back to the car, my father paused and looked up at the electrical wires above, a net of steel and cable stretching across the autumn sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, Paul,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;every day at work, we have a little contest before lunch.&#x201d;<br> <br>I had no idea what he was talking about.<br> <br>A contest? Before lunch?<br> <br>Sounded like something we might have done at Grace Lutheran, where I went to elementary school in the Bronx.<br> <br>&#x201c;We draw straws to see who has to go out and pick up sandwiches for the whole crew. If you get the shortest straw, you&#x2019;re the delivery boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was the beginning. From there, my father went on to tell us the story of the day he drew the short straw. While he was out picking up sandwiches, there was a terrible accident back on the job. Someone had accidentally thrown a switch, restoring power to an area where three men were working. Tragically, all three men were electrocuted instantly. When my father returned, he couldn&#x2019;t believe his eyes. The bodies of his coworkers were being peeled off the high-tension wires.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right up there,&#x201d; he said quietly, looking overhead. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where it happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>He paused, put a hand on my shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I hadn&#x2019;t drawn the short straw that day, I&#x2019;d have been up there in those wires, and I wouldn&#x2019;t be here right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked at the wires, then at my father. He smiled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sometimes you get lucky.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad would repeat that story from time to time, just often enough to keep the nightmares flowing. That wasn&#x2019;t his intent, of course&#x2014;he always related the tale in a whimsical &#x201c;what if?&#x201d; tone&#x2014;but it was the outcome nonetheless. You tell a little kid that his old man was nearly fried to death, and you&#x2019;re sentencing him to a few years of sweaty, terror-filled nights beneath the sheets. I get his point now, though. You never know what life might bring... or when it might come to a screeching halt.<br> <br>And it&#x2019;s best to act accordingly.<br> <br>The Carl Frehley I knew (and it&#x2019;s important to note that I didn&#x2019;t know him all that well) was quiet and reserved, a model of middle-class decorum, maybe because he was so fucking tired all the time. My father was forty-seven years old by the time I came into this world, and I sometimes think he was actually deep into a second life at that point. The son of German and Dutch immigrants, he&#x2019;d grown up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, finished three years of college, and had to leave school and go to work. Later on he moved to New York and married Esther Hecht, a pretty young girl seventeen years his junior. My mom had been raised on a farm in Norlina, North Carolina. My grandfather was from northern Germany&#x2014;the island R�gen, to be precise. My grandmother was also German, but I&#x2019;d always heard whispers of there being some American Indian blood in our family. It was boredom, more than anything else, that brought my mom to New York. Tired of life on the farm, she followed her older sister Ida north and lived with her for a while in Brooklyn.<br> <br>Dad, meanwhile, came for the work.<br> <br>There was always a little bit of mystery surrounding my dad, things he never shared; nooks and crannies of his past were always a taboo subject. He married late, started a family late, and settled into a comfortable domestic and professional routine. Every so often, though, there were glimpses of a different man, a different life.<br> <br>My dad was an awesome bowler, for example. He never talked about being part of a bowling league or even how he learned the game. God knows he only bowled occasionally while I was growing up, but when he did, he nailed it. He had his own ball, his own shoes, and textbook form that helped him throw a couple of perfect games. He was also an amazing pool player, a fact I discovered while still in elementary school, when he taught me how to shoot. Dad could do things with a pool cue that only the pros could do, and when I look back on it now I realize he may have spent some time in a few shady places. He once told me that he had beaten the champion of West Virginia in a game of pool. I guess you have to be pretty good to beat the state champion of any sport.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Dad. What&#x2019;s your high run?&#x201d; I once asked him while we were shooting pool.<br> <br>&#x201c;One forty-nine,&#x201d; he said, without even looking up.<br> <br>Holy shit...<br> <br>I must have been only about ten years old at the time, and I didn&#x2019;t immediately grasp the enormity of that number, but I quickly realized it meant making 149 consecutive shots without missing.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s ten fuckin&#x2019; racks!<br> <br>You have to know what you&#x2019;re doing to polish off that many balls without screwing up. And that little piece of information, coupled with the times I saw him execute trick shots and one-handed shots, made me wonder even more about his elusive past. Perhaps, when he was younger, he lived life in the fast lane and we had much more in common than one might think. Maybe, just maybe, Carl Frehley kicked some ass.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s kinda fun to think so, anyway.<br> <br>I grew up just off Mosholu Parkway in the Bronx, not far from the New York Botanical Garden and Bronx Zoo. It was a middle-class neighborhood of mixed ethnic backgrounds, consisting of mostly German, Irish, Jewish, and Italian families. Ours was pretty normal and loving, a fact I came to appreciate even more after I began hanging out with some serious badasses who were always trying to escape their violent and abusive home lives. Conversely, my dad never hit or abused me as a child, but I often wondered how much he really cared about me since we never did anything together one-on-one. Now as I think back, I realize more and more that he loved me, and that he did the best he could under the circumstances.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s pretty hard to look at the Frehleys and suggest that my upbringing contributed in any way to my wild and crazy lifestyle and the insanity that was to ensue. Sure, my dad was a workaholic and never home, but there was always food on the table, and we all felt secure. My parents enjoyed a happy and affectionate marriage&#x2014;I can still see them holding hands as they walked down the street, or kissing when Dad came home from work. They always seemed happy together, and there was very little fighting at home. We had relatives in Brooklyn and North Carolina, all on my mother&#x2019;s side, but I knew very little about my dad&#x2019;s side of the family. There were no photo albums or letters, no interesting stories or visits from aunts and uncles. Nothing. I knew he had a brother who had tragically drowned at age eight, but the rest was sketchy at best. When I tried to ask him for more details, my mom would intervene.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t push your father,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too painful for him.&#x201d;<br> <br>So I&#x2019;d let it go.<br> <br>People who know me only as the Spaceman probably find this hard to believe, but I was raised in a family that stressed education and religion. My parents also understood the value of the arts and sciences. The way I&#x2019;m fascinated with computers and guitars, my dad was fascinated with motors and electrical circuits, and he used to build his own batteries in the basement as a child. I know he was very good at what he did because in addition to his work at West Point, he also serviced the elevator motors in the Empire State Building, and was involved in designing the backup ignition system for the Apollo spacecraft for NASA. He had notebooks filled with formulas and sketches, projects he worked on until the wee hours of the morning.<br> <br>So my parents emphasized learning, and two of their three children got the message. My sister, Nancy, who is eight years my senior, was a straight-A student who went on to get a master&#x2019;s degree in chemistry; she taught high school chemistry for a while before getting married to start a family. My brother, Charles, was an honors student as well. He studied classical guitar at New York University, where he finished tenth in his class.<br> <br>Then there was me, Paul Frehley, the youngest of three kids and the black sheep to boot.<br> <br>In the beginning I enjoyed school and team sports, but as I got older, my social life and music began taking precedence over my studies. I remember coming home with B&#x2019;s, C&#x2019;s, and D&#x2019;s on my report card and hearing my parents complain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you be more like Charlie and Nancy?&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d just throw up my hands. Between bands and girlfriends, who had time to study?<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wasting your life, Paul,&#x201d; my dad would say, shaking his head.<br> <br>Once, just to prove a point, I told my parents that I&#x2019;d study hard for a semester and prove I was just as bright as my brother and sister. And you know what? I got all A&#x2019;s and B&#x2019;s on the next report card. (Much later, it was the same sort of &#x201c;I told you so&#x201d; attitude that would compel me to challenge the other guys in KISS to an IQ test. Just for the record, I scored highest: 163, which is considered &#x201c;genius.&#x201d;) Now, I know I drove my parents crazy, but God had other plans for me. It all stemmed from something I sensed at an early age: the desire to become a rock star and follow my dreams. Crazy as that sounds, I really believed it would happen.<br> <br>You can partially credit my blind ambition to Mom and Dad! You see, if there was a common thread within our family, it was music. Thanks to the influence of our parents, all the Frehley kids played instruments. My father was an accomplished concert pianist: he could perform Chopin and Mozart effortlessly. My mom played the piano, too, and she enjoyed banging out a few tunes at family gatherings. Charlie and Nancy took piano lessons and performed at recitals as well. They eventually started fooling around with the guitar and formed a folk group, but that was never my cup of tea. From the beginning, I was drawn to rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll and started figuring out songs by the Beatles and the Stones on my brother&#x2019;s acoustic guitar. One day, by chance, I picked up my friend&#x2019;s new electric guitar and checked it out. I plugged it in, turned the amp up to ten, and strummed a power chord.<br> <br>I immediately fell in love. It was a life-changing event! I was only twelve, but I was totally hooked. Within a couple of years I had a Fender Tele and a Marshall amp in my bedroom, and I&#x2019;d sold my soul to rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll. There was no turning back.<br> <br>My parents were not entirely unsupportive of my obsession (Dad even bought me my first electric guitar as a Christmas present), probably because it beat the alternative. There were worse vices, worse behavior, as I&#x2019;d already demonstrated. See, at the same time that I was teaching myself guitar and forming my first band, I was also running with a pretty tough crowd. So while it may be true that the rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll lifestyle nearly killed me as an adult, it&#x2019;s also true that without music, I might never have made it to adulthood in the first place.<br> <br>I started hanging out with the toughest guys in the neighborhood when I was still in grammar school, playing poker, drinking, cutting school&#x2014;generally just looking for trouble. At first I was uncomfortable with some of the things I had to do, but I learned pretty quickly that alcohol made everything a lot easier. I didn&#x2019;t like to fight, but fearlessness came with a few beers. Talking to girls was sometimes awkward, but with a little buzz I could charm them right out of their pants.<br> <br>The first drink? I remember it well. Every drinker remembers his first drink, just as vividly as he remembers his first fuck. I was eleven years old and hanging out with my brother and his friend Jeffrey. Jeff&#x2019;s father had a small cabin on City Island in the Bronx, and we went there one Friday after school. The plan was to do some fishing and hang out. I loved fishing when I was a kid; I still do. And it was on that weekend that I discovered that beer went hand in hand with fishing. Jeff&#x2019;s dad had left a six-pack of Schaefer beer in the fridge, and we each had a can or two. Not exactly hard-core drinking, but enough to get me comfortably numb. I can remember exactly how it felt, smooth and dry. Pretty soon I felt kind of lightheaded and silly, and I couldn&#x2019;t stop laughing. Then I passed out. The next thing I remember is waking up in the morning with a slight headache and a dry mouth, but to be honest, I couldn&#x2019;t wait to do it again.<br> <br>And I didn&#x2019;t wait. Not long, anyway.<br> <br>The following weekend, we ended up going to a party with more beer and girls&#x2014;older girls! I&#x2019;d been attracted to girls for a while by now, but this was unexplored territory. Here I was, playing Spin the Bottle and Seven Minutes in Heaven with thirteen-year-olds, but after my first beer, all I can remember is thinking, <i>bring it on!</i><br> <br>I&#x2019;d found girls and alcohol to be a great combination.<br> <br>The rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll would soon follow.<br> <br>� 2011 Ace Frehley</p><h2>Gaudi: A Biography</h2><p><p>At the time of his death in 1926, Antonio Gaudi was arguably the most famous architect in the world. He had created some of the greatest and most controversial masterpieces of modern architecture, which were as exotic as they were outrageous. For many, Gaudi's unique architecture is Barcelona. But little is known about the shadowy figure behind the swirling, vivid buildings that inspired the surrealists. A fervent Catholic with an unstinting love for Catalonia, his homeland, an innovator who was profoundly orthodox, and a hermit who chose lifelong celibacy, having been rejected by the woman he loved, Gaudi was both brilliant and eccentric. He was very much the product of his time and place, and this masterful biography brings both man and architect powerfully to life against the changing backdrop of Barcelona and Catalonia.</p><p>Gijs van Hensbergen leads us through the design and construction of Gaudi's most significant buildings, revealing their innovation and complexity and demonstrating the growing relevance of Gaudi's architecture today. The author captures not only the power and importance of Gaudi's work but the unique spirit of Catalan culture as well.</p><p>This supreme artist lived by extravagant gestures and a creativity that bordered on madness. Even his legendary death under a tram as he stepped back to admire his cathedral in Barcelona has the hint of absurdity and poetry. In this first critical biography of one of Spain's most celebrated artists and the twentieth century's greatest architect, Gijs van Hensbergen makes a compelling argument for Gaudi's stature as icon of artistic integrity and genius.</p></p><p>The sinuous forms and lavish decorations of Antonio Gaud� (1852-1926) broke the mold in architecture. "His imagination burnt holes through the musty pattern books," writes Gijs van Hensbergen. "His gift was an amazing capacity to imagine a building and then transform it into reality." Gaud�'s fantastical creations give Barcelona an appearance unlike any other city in the world. One of the paradoxes that informs his many-layered biography is that this most original of architects was politically conservative and profoundly Catholic, fired by the desire to celebrate the history and culture of his native Catalonia. Hensbergen, author of books on art deco and travel in Spain, devotes a good deal of his book to situating Gaud�'s life and thought within the context of Catalonian traditions, particularly the 19th-century Renaixen�a, which sought to revive the region's language (Catalan) and to affirm its national identity against the Spanish government's desire to absorb it. He surrounds Gaud�, too often depicted as an isolated eccentric, with the friends and patrons who shared his vision, illuminating the architect's impact both within Catalonia and beyond its borders. (Admirers included the surrealists, whose atheism and radicalism were anathema to Gaud�.) Detailed knowledge of Gaud�'s leisurely, wickedly expensive working methods and the complex use he made of previous architectural traditions gives us a better understanding of the unique nature of his genius, while Hensbergen's obvious (though not uncritical) affection for his subject as a man helps us appreciate "an extraordinarily creative and religiously charged life." <i>--Wendy Smith</i><p>Gijs Van Hensbergen lectures in architecture and is the author of <em>Art Deco</em> and of the highly acclaimed travel book <em>A Taste of Castille</em>.

In a little geo at the village of Shawbost on the Atlantic coast of Lewis in the Western Isles a group of crofter women were gathering seaweed. The inward surge of an ataireachd bhuan (&#39;the everlasting swell&#39;) swirled up to their feet. Beneath the outward heave of the receding water the shingle grumbled. It was on this day that Calum Smith was born, and his mother was one of those who was working on the beach on that day. While his childhood was a happy one, it was one of very considerable poverty, and his story gives a unique insight into life on Lewis through the First World War and to the opening of the Second. Full of humour and life, his memoirs are a celebration of a still largely Gaelic culture and society in the throes of great change. His boyhood and education took place in and around Stornoway (at Shawbost and Laxdale) and the book is peopled with characters and families well known in Lewis to this day. It is also the story of an island and community at a time now at the edge of memory and about which little is written. On the morning of Sunday, 3 September, none of us could summon up any enthusiasm for the habitual after-breakfast walk. Instead we were hovering about the radio in the lounge, waiting for what we all knew would be shattering news, while at the same time trying to convince ourselves, rather hopelessly, that it would not be. When, at eleven, the sombre announcement was made that we were once again at war with Germany, we five looked at one another in what I can only think of now as resignation. Never again would things be the same for any of us.</p><p>Calum Smith now lives in Cullen. This is his first book, though he previously wrote a regular column in the Stornoway Gazette. He served on the Stornoway Town Council as Dean of Guild and Senior Baillie and was on the Stornoway Trust, administrating the Stornoway Estate. He was chairman of the Western Isles Labour party</p><h2>The Energetics of Western Herbs: A Materia Medica Integrating Western and Oriental Herbal Medicine Traditions</h2><p>This newly-updated text presents the comprehensive principles of natural herbal therapy.

It is safe to say that there is no other English-language novelist writing about America who is so little known in the United States. <i>An Innocent Millionaire</i> has been rejected by every New York publisher before its success in England, and although it was eventually published in New York, it remained for foreign critics to point out that the novel "shows all the worms in the Big Apple (Antonio Deblas) and "Vizinczey's New York attorneys make Balzac's shyster lawyers look like little orphan boys." (Martin Halter).Bravo! This long serious beautifully organized novel is the more readable for containing the best funny scene I have read since Evelyn Waugh died. <br><b>Graham Greene</b> <p> A humour more mature than that of Wodehouse or even Waugh... Shows where the true values lie - not in wealth or the rule of law but in that as yet inviolate sector where a man and woman make love... The distinction of the book lies in its calm clean prose style as well as the solidity of its characters, good and detestable alike. Vizinczey, who loves Stendhal and Balzac, is of the school that believes the author has a right to comment. Whatever the villains get away with in the narrative, they are not immune from the laconic judgments of the author... I was entertained but also deeply moved: here is a novel set bang in the middle of our decadent, polluted, corrupt world that, in some curious way, breathes a kind of desperate hope. <br><b>Anthony Burgess, <i>PUNCH</i></b> </p><p> Brilliantly inventive, written with great flair and shows a deliciously comic and ironic sense of American realities.<br> <b>Alfred Kazin</b> </p><p> A tragic and enthralling love story... There is no doubt whatever that Vizinczey is one of the great writers of our time.<br> <i>This refers to the Spanish edition of the novel</i><br> <b>Angel Vivas, <i> Album</i>, Madrid</b> </p><p> One of those writers who emerge full-grown from obscurity to fame. A Hungarian emigre whom English fits like a second skin, he is, like Conrad and Nabokov, one of the "extra-territorial writers" as Steiner calls them... Vizinczey succeeds in making the reader laugh and he also knows how to surprise us. His disenchanted gaze penetrates the secret of things. He goes for the substantial and functional, but never lingers on the obvious. His novel is acid, sensual, romantic, satirical, and the ending is both tragic and uplifting.<br> <i>This refers to the Spanish edition of the novel</i><br> <b>Ventura Melia, <i>Levante</i>, Alicante</b> </p><p> Vizinczey portrays all the worms of the Big Apple. <i>An Innocent Millionaire</i> is a roar of laughter which does not shirk tragedy. It has the European touch universalized by Central Europeans like Wilder and Lubitsch. The book exudes the joy of living.<br> <i>This refers to the Spanish edition of the novel</i><br> <b>Antonio Deblas, <i>La Vox de Asturias</i>, Aviles</b> </p><p> Vizinczey wrote in an essay: "If we want to know how the world holds together, we have to read Pushkin, Gogol, Kleist, Stendhal, Balzac, Tolstoy; if we want to know how the world falls apart, we have to read Dostoevsky". After re-reading <i>In Praise of Older Women, An Innocent Millionaire, Truth and Lies in Literature</i>, a re-reader of these living books acquired this certainty: if we want to know how the world holds together and how it falls apart, we have to read Stephen Vizinczey.<br> <i>This refers to the Mexican edition of the novel</i><br> <b>Jose Luis Perdomo Orellana, <i>etcetera</i>, Mexico City</b> </p><p> Lays bare American society with biting humour. It is a very subtle book, demanding continuous reflection.<br> <i>This refers to the Argentinian edition of the novel</i><br> <b>Luis F Nunez, <i>La Nacion</i>, Buenos Aires</b> </p><p> Vizinczey is one of the great literary discoveries of recent years. He is a writer whose characters engage our interest for their own sake as individuals, even outside the story.<br> <i>This refers to the Brazilian edition of the novel</i><br> <b><i>Veja</i>, Sao Paulo</b> </p><p> A thrilling story, written with supreme skill and moral passion.<br> <b>James Bentley, <i>BBC World Service</i>, London</b> </p><p> This is a terrific book. You will love it. You will not wash dishes, neither will you mow the lawn, but you will sit and read and lament when you have passed the half-way mark. Vizinczey's previous novel, In Praise of Older Women, was one of the most charming books of the century, and <i>An Innocent Millionaire</i> displays the same quality... His story of Mark Niven's obsessive search for a sunken treasure, his triumphs and failures through an erratic boyhood and youth, his discovery of the treasure and true love at the same time and 'what happened next' is fast-moving and racy, funny and sad. But the novel is not just a tour de force of popular appeal... Irony informs the book's style more than anything else. Vizinczey takes delight in deflating the moral imperatives of the age... The irony extends to all the human relationships in the book. Children turn their power on their parents, the biter gets bitten in the law courts, the mega-polluter becomes paranoid about pollution and drives his household crazy using bottled water... Not for Vizinczey detachment or the illusion that the story is taking place in the continuous present. By shamelessly staying in control and looking ahead, the author is able to make scenes - such as the conclusion of a deal between treasure-laden Mark Niven and the rapacious New York agent Vallantine - almost unbearably wry: "Vallantine came and went, taking his copy of the contract. 'I hope this will be the beginning of a lifelong association, Mark,' he said as they shook hands on the deal. They would never see each other again."</p><p>You can't write books like Vizinczey's out of greed or vanity (the motivation behind most bestsellers), rather you need to have suffered, loved, worked and laughed. To be able to distill those experiences into enjoyable literature is a great gift which deserves a great reward."<br> <b>Peter Corris, <i>The National Times</i>, Australia</b> </p><p> A dazzling performance. It is as if Balzac had come back to life and written a novel about the modern world of jet planes and chemical manufacturers.<br> <b>Robert Fulford, <i>The Toronto Star</i></b> </p><p> Finally we have the triumph of tone of Stephen Vizinczey's <i>An Innocent Millionaire</i>. An ironic romance, the novel involves us in young Mark Niven's quixotic quest for the Flora, a treasure ship sunk in the Bahamas in the nineteenth century, and the unexpectedly more difficult task of defending his acquisition. Paradoxically, Mark's single-minded obsession, from age fourteen on, with finding and keeping a three-hundred-million-dollar fortune is presented sympathetically as innocent idealism, exposing the greed and ruthlessness around him, just as his affair with a young married heiress, Marianne Hardwick, affects us as a pure, moving love story. The novel is rich in interest and drama, but it is the witty, experienced narrative voice, with its ironic aphorisms, sardonic asides, and the astute running commentary on human weakness and foibles, which invests a lively adventure story of love and intrigue with broader significance... Taken in isolation, the cynical commentary - on legal deviousness, industrial corruption, business insensitivity, media equivocation, art fraud, and so on - might suggest a narrow, embittered perspective. Certainly the indictment of the legal profession in particular is virulent. But this is one dimension only of a broad moral vision, exacting and unequivocal but large-spirited, which balances censure with shrewd affirmations and affectionate appreciation for human potential. For all the meanness, unscrupulousness, and self-deception mordantly exposed, An Innocent Millionaire also provides convincing displays of integrity, selflessness and love... <br> <b>Helen Hoy,<i>University of Toronto Quarterly</i></b></p></p><h2>Graceful Passages: A Companion for Living and Dying</h2><p>In words and music, Graceful Passages provides an atmosphere of relaxation, fresh insight, and a renewal of faith for anyone exploring the challenge of dealing with grief from the loss of a loved one. Cofounders of the Companion Arts Foundation, the authors have gathered Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Native American, Confucian, and Buddhist sages to create a truly broad-ranging multifaith resource. From many perspectives the themes of letting go, closure, expressing love, forgiveness, appreciation of life, and the continuity of spirit are reviewed. We hear the words and voices of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, Thich Nhat Hanh, Ram Dass, Arun and Suranda Gandhi, Sam Keen, Dr. Ira Byock, Kathleen Dowling Singh, and others. A customized musical score composed by an award-winning composer and pioneering healing music artist, stunning still-life color photographs, and a handsome design make this set a gift to treasure in both good times and bad.</p><p>Each year half of America will be touched by the death of a friend or loved one. Bill Moyers, whose landmark PBS series on dying aired in September of 2000 (which listed Graceful Passages as a primary musical resource) writes, "Surveys show that Americans- including baby boomers (estimated at nearly 80 million people in their late forties and fifties) who are becoming aware of their own mortality while caring for their elderly parents- are exploring issues of death and dying with new openness. Awareness is growing that we can and must improve care at the end of life." Feature articles in Time, The Wall Street Journal and other mainstream media show growing attention to this issue. <p>The wonder of life is often overlooked. The preciousness of being alive, of appreciating ourselves, each other, and our world, is sometimes the last thing we remember in our rush. </p><p>Despite advances in medical science, we are neither capable of preventing our transition from this world nor in control of the timing. As reluctant as we may be to approach the subject, admitting our mortality is an important step toward embracing life on its own terms. Such an acceptance can profoundly support a recognition of the moment-by-moment gift of life itself. </p><p>At any stage of life, suffering is increased by denial and resistance. This applies equally to those at the beginning, middle, or end of life. There is a need for effective, artful ways to ease the shift from resistance to acceptance, to address anyone who is going through or anticipating loss. </p><p>Our response has been Graceful Passages, A Companion for Living and Dying, a 2-CD giftbook of spoken voices and music addressing this issue. We have recorded people, among whom are foremost experts in the field of loss and transition, speaking candidly on the key elements common to the dying process, themes which are relevant at any stage of life. </p><p>These themes include: the process of letting go, elements of closure. giving and receiving love, forgiveness , appreciation of life, and continuity of spirit. </p><p>The people we have selected as speakers, coming from different traditions, share an extraordinary quality of presence which infuses their words with a tender, universal eloquence. The messages they deliver are spoken in an atmosphere of peaceful honoring. </p><p>To further enhance the delivery of these messages of acceptance, we have created music to support the psycho-spiritual transition observed in dying persons, created with the intention of gently addressing persons behind the resistance of their conscious defenses. This music is intended to provide an opportunity for all listeners to both relax and to feel supported in freely expressing feelings with or without words, thus more easily experiencing reconciliation, resolution and peaceful transitions, wherever they may be on the continuum of life. </p><p>Our sincere appreciation to the Nathan Cummings Foundation, Fund For Global Awakening, and all who have contributed financially to this endeavor. We tithe 10% of this product to hospice and numerous organizations.</p>Bringing forth Graceful Passages has been a continuous process of letting go, of opening to the immensity, uniqueness and simplicity that each dying represents. The pace of surrender has been relentless, including the frequent transformation or termination of concepts, assumptions and deadlines. <p>I have been greatly moved by the wise beings encountered throughout this project. It was a special blessing to record all the speakers, more than we were able to include in this volume. Working with Gary&#x2019;s artistry and dedication has been a true gift, as has been the extraordinary outpouring of goodwill from everyone we met along the way. Originally intended as a resource to support those exiting from this earth life, Graceful Passages has turned out to be an inspirational portal for reverently and courageously embracing this world. &#x2013;Michael Stillwater </p><p>I had the honor to be with my father during his last weeks on Earth. His farewells were made with such loving presence and dignity that my perceptions of death were forever changed. </p><p>So when my friend Michael Stillwater called, I was ready for what he proposed. His own father had recently died, and the passage had inspired a vision of using music to heal people&#x2019;s hearts touched by the mystery of death. Compelled by the memory of my father&#x2019;s final days, I embraced the dream wholeheartedly. </p><p>Graceful Passages is an offering to all who wish to be deeply met at this doorway. I feel privileged to have worked with Michael and with such magnificent speakers and musicians to create a work more moving than I could have envisioned. Wherever you are on this journey, my hope is that Graceful Passages will inspire gratitude for the precious gift of life. -Gary Remal Malkin</p></p><h2>Fabian Freeway: High Road to Socialism in the U.S.A, 1884 - 1966</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

And from each blazing gash of destruction, wave after wave of ships lifted from the conquerors' camps and garrisons, on fiery, untempered columns of full fusion exhaust. </p><p> As those ships exploded upward through the planet's smoke-filled atmosphere, the sonic booms of their passing were like the echo of the death-screams of the ravished world they left behind. The jewel-like sparkle of the departing ships' thrusters like the glittering tears of that world's lost gods. </p><p> On this day, on this world, sixty years of butchery and brutality had at last come to an end. </p><p> But on the dark station that was Terok Nor, with viewports that flashed with phaser bursts and shimmered with the fire of its own inner destruction, there was still far worse to come. </p><p> On this day, the Day of Withdrawal, the Cardassians were leaving. But they had not left yet... </p><p><br> Held within the cold and patient silence of space, the Promenade of Terok Nor itself was a tumultuous pocket universe of heat and noise and confusion. </p><p> The security gates that had bisected its circular path had by now collapsed, twisted by hammers and wirecutters and the frantically grasping hands of slaves set free. Glowing restraint conduits that once had bound the gates now cracked and sparked and sent strobing flashes into the dense blue haze that choked the air, still Cardassian-hot. </p><p> Hull plates resonated with the violent release of multiple, escaping shuttles and ships. A thrumming wall of sound sprang up as departing soldiers phasered equipment too heavy to steal. </p><p> Decks shook as rampaging looters forced internal doors and shattered windows. Among the empty shelves of the Chemist's shop, a Bajoran lay dying, Cardassian blood on his hands, Cardassian bootprints on his back, his collaboration with the enemy no guarantee of safety in the madness of this day. </p><p> Turbolifts whined and ladders rattled against their moorings. Officers shouted hoarse commands. Soldiers cursed their victims. In counterpoint, a calm recorded voice recited the orders of the day. "Attention, all biorganic materials must be disposed of according to regulations. Attention...." </p><p> But on this day, the only response to that directive was the desperate, high-pitched shriek of a Ferengi in fear for his life. And in fear for good reason. </p><p> Quark the barkeep kicked and fought and shrieked again, as the Cardassian soldiers, safe in their scarred, hard-edged armor, dragged him from his bar, soiling and tearing his snug multicolored jacket. </p><p> Quark opened his eyes just long enough to recognize the scowling officer, Datar, a glinn, who waited for him with a coil of ODN cable. In the same quick glimpse, he saw the antigrav lifter from a cargo bay bobbing in the air nearby; he heard the soldiers as they mockingly chanted the last words he would hear before he stood at the doors of the Divine Treasury to give a full accounting of his life -- </p><p> <i>"Dabo! Dabo! Dabo!"</i> </p><p> Yet even as he faced his last minute of existence, Quark still couldn't help automatically tallying the damages each time he heard a crash from his establishment as the Cardassian forces laid waste to it. </p><p> A sudden blow slammed Quark to the Promenade deck, and a quick, savage kick from a heavy leather boot forestalled any thought of escape. </p><p> But even as he cried out in pain, Quark wondered if his brother and nephew had made it to a shuttle, and if the Cardassians had found his latinum floor vault. He gasped in shock as he felt Glinn Datar's rough hand claw at the sensitive lobes of his right ear, the violation forcing him to his feet. In the same terrible moment, Quark found himself wondering just why it was Cardassians always had such truly disgusting breath. </p><p> "Quark!" the glinn growled at him. "You have no idea how it pains me to take my leave of you." </p><p> "All good things," Quark muttered as waves of incredible pain radiated from his crushed right ear lobe and across his skull and neck. </p><p> Datar's swift, expert punch to the center of his stomach doubled Quark over, his lips gaping in vain for even a mouthful of air. </p><p> "Relax, Quark," the glinn hissed, reaching out for Quark's earlobe again. "It's not necessary for you to speak -- ever again!" </p><p> Quark felt himself hauled up until he stared right into Datar's narrowed eyes. He felt his poor earlobe throb painfully, already starting to swell. </p><p> "My men and I are going to make this a real farewell." The glinn nodded once and Quark felt huge hands forcibly secure his shoulders and arms from behind. Datar addressed his soldiers as if reading from a proclamation. "Quark of Terok Nor, you miserable mound of <i>sluk</i> scum: For the crime of rigging your dabo table, for the crime of watering your drinks, short-timing the holosuites, inflating tabs, and...most of all for the crime of being a <i>Ferengi...</i>I sentence you to death!" </p><p> Incredulous, Quark tried to plead his innocence, but his rasping exhortations were drowned out by the cheers of the surrounding soldiers. He tried to blurt out the combination of his floor vault, the shuttle access codes Rom and Nog were going to use to escape, even made-up names of resistance fighters, but the sharp cutting pressure of the ODN cable Glin Datar suddenly wrapped around his neck ended any chance he had of saying a word. Even the squeak that escaped him then registered as little more than a soon-to-be-dead man's choked-off wheeze. </p><p> Eyes bulging, each racing heartbeat thundering in his cavernous ear tunnels, Quark could only watch as two soldiers hooked the other end of the thick cable to the grappler on the cargo antigrav. </p><p> Datar slammed his hand on the antigrav's control and the meter-long device bucked up a few centimeters, steadied itself, then rose smoothly and slowly and inexorably, trailing cable until it passed the Promenade's second level. </p><p> The cable snapped taut against Quark's neck, yanking him at last from the grip of the soldiers who had held him. Kicking frantically, he felt a boot fly free. He grimaced in embarrassment as he realized his toes were sticking through the holes worn in his foot wrappings. Hadn't his moogie told him to always wear fresh underclothes? </p><p> Even Quark knew that was a foolish thought to have, especially at the moment in which he was drawing his last breath. His fingers scrabbled at the cable around his neck, but it was too tight and in too many layers for him to change the pressure. </p><p> Dimly through the pounding that now filled his head, Quark could hear the soldiers' laughter and hooting. Even as his vision darkened, he raged at himself for having failed to predict how quickly the end of the Occupation would come. </p><p> He had seen the signs, discussed it with his suppliers. Another month, he had concluded, perhaps two. Time enough to profit from the Cardassian soldiers being shipped out, eager to convert their Bajoran "souvenirs" to more easily transportable latinum. He had even already booked his passage on a freighter and -- </p><p> -- Dark stars sparkled at the rapidly shrinking edge of Quark's vision, as he mourned the deposit he had paid to Captain Yates. Just then the roar of something large approaching -- something loud and silent all at the same time -- swallowed the jeers of the Cardassians, and Quark felt himself fall, flooded with shock that he was not ascending to the Divine Treasury but apparently on his way to the Debtors' Dungeon. How could that be possible? He had lived a life of greed and self-absorption. How could he not be rewarded with eternal dividends? He wanted to speak to someone in charge. He wanted to renegotiate the deal. He</p></p><h2>The Groaning of Creation: God, Evolution, and the Problem of Evil</h2><p><p>Pain, suffering, and extinction are intrinsic to the evolutionary process.

But as Giuliano comes to realize, they don't know what they're fighting for&#x2015;if they're even fighting for anything. </p><p><i>Notes for a War Story</i> is an astonishing look at life in a lawless, war-torn nation, heightened by the harsh, moving, pencil and watercolor artwork of Italy's best graphic novel author.</p></p><p><p>Gipi's pencil and watercolor art is forceful, realistic, and evocative, the ideal medium for depicting the rough and raw subject matter of this graphic novel.

With duotone panels thronging each page, and spidery line work ripe with menace, Giuliano tells of a life bereft of elementals &#x2014; food, shelter and clean water, let alone family &#x2014; where gangsters squat at the apex of the food chain. Ever so subtly, Gipi slips readers into the shoes of Giuliano and his two companions as they drift into the bad life. &#x201c;During the war in Bosnia, during the siege of Sarajevo, during the dead in Sniper Alley,&#x201c; says the author, &#x201c;I was in Italy, very few kilometers away as the crow flies. I was living my life without incident, without any sudden upset. Men and boys were dying in Bosnia, but they weren&#x2019;t my brothers or countrymen. Why weren&#x2019;t they? Because some bureaucrats had drawn a line on a map to divide the two countries. In the book, I erased that line. With that simple gesture, the war arrived in my home, in my country. I erased that line and let a nearby war take a step closer and become mine. Mine, and the three boys in this story, who have to learn how to grow up in wartime.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kirkus</p><p>Review in August 2007 issue of VOYA </p><p>4Q 5P</p><p>In a nameless, wartorn, European country, three young men fall under the spell of Felix, a charismatic opportunist. Stefano, known as Little Killer, enthusiastically embraces Felix&#x2019;s lifestyle. Christian, an orphan, is just grateful to have a place to belong. Only Giuliano, an outsider by virtue of his more stable family, sometimes questions what they are doing. At Felix&#x2019;s behest, they engage in petty crime and profiteering, gradually escalating to violence. When Felix orders the three to head to the actual war zone, Giuliano realizes they have no idea why they will be fighting and slips away to return home. Trying to find his feet in a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; life, he still feels ambivalent about his decision to abandon his friends.</p><p>In this powerful graphic novel, award-winning Italian artist Gipi uses deceptively crude black-and-white panels to portray a world sliding into chaos. Young men &#x2014; for women appear only as background &#x2014; are left adrift as society unravels. Giuliano&#x2019;s recurring dreams of headless men is a powerful metaphor for both the failure of those around him to think for themselves and for their lack of inner resources. The final section of the book, in which a documentary filmmaker interviews Giuliano, seems frustratingly inconclusive, until the reader realizes that all parties involved are trying to piece together an understanding of what happened, that all anyone has are &#x201c;notes for a war story.&#x201d; Far from the fantasy world of many graphic novels, this volume will surprise and challenge readers. &#x2014;<em>Kathleen Beck</em></p><p></p><p>Review July 7th 2007 issue of Booklist</p><p>Revisiting themes from his first American release, <em>Garage Band</em>, Italian writer and artist Gipi tells a much darker story of disassociated youth and the bonds of friendship. Giuliano, Christian, and Little Killer wander aimlessly about an unidentified Balkan country, avoiding the militia and the shelling that an ubiquitous war has brought to their homeland. When they get into the good graces of Felix, a charming dangerous war profiteer, they become embroiled in his crime operations and sent to the big city, where their friendship and mettle are put to the test. As grim as could be, from the bleak narration to the intentionally gruesome, black-and-white art, WAR STORY never loses track of the fact that these are children, swept up in a situation too difficult for most adults to grasp. Their youth &#x2014; evidenced by their covetous enthusiasm for motorcycles and video games &#x2014; exacerbates the class jealousies, which flair up repeatedly, and the braggadocio with which two of the trio head toward their disturbing and inevitable end. </p><p>Bulletin of the Center for Children&#x2019;s Books, July 2007</p><p>Young adults who followed the comparatively tame aspirations of the quartet in Gipi&#x2019;s <em>Garage Band </em> will find themselves in a drastically different milieu here in this imported graphic novel. Three teenage boys roam the bombed-out villages of their nameless southern European nation in a nameless war, drawn together by convenience rather than friendship. In dire need of shelter and cash, they offer their services to crime boss Felix, and self-styled &#x201c;Little Killer&#x201d; Stefano shows real enthusiasm for the job, running contraband and then working his way up to collecting &#x201c;debts&#x201d; in Felix&#x2019;s extortion operation. Stefano takes over as the trio&#x2019;s de facto leader, reveling in his newfound power, while orphan Christian glories in camaraderie and wealth, and narrator Giuliano admits to embracing the thrills. Ultimately Felix has a grander plan for the boys, sending them off to fight with a militia; armed with assault weapons but no sense of mission. Giuliano comes to his senses and bails out. The conclusion finds him several years later, being interviewed by a movie crew (&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a film, it&#x2019;s a documentary. They&#x2019;re two different things&#x201d;) about his experiences in the recently past war; the former wartime exploiter is not being exploited by an arty type of profiteer. As the cameramen rush off to capture footage of fighters returning under protection of an amnesty agreement, Giuliano sees in the coat-shrouded figures the embodiment of his old nightmares, in which his headless comrades (no conscience? no plan? no identity?) upbraid him for being a soft, coddled boy with a family to which he can retreat whenever he chooses. The desolate villages and corrupt city are rendered in extraordinary details and washed with an appropriately dearly, monotonous military green. The boys, whose solid bodies are crowned by faces dashed off in a few wiry lines, bear striking similarity to the <em>Garage Band</em> guys, and it&#x2019;s clear that with just one cruel political flick of the wrist, those ordinary joes could share the same fate. Teens who have moved to horror and compassion by Beah&#x2019;s <em>A Long Way Gone</em> will find this work challenging and provocative. </p><p>Review in 7/1 School Library Journal</p><p><strong>Gr 11 Up</strong>&#x2013;On January 18th, in an unnamed Balkan country, war breaks out. Caught up in adolescence, Giuliano and his friends invent new measures of manhood. Can&#x2019;t walk calmly under threat of sniper fire? Points off. While trying to sell stolen goods, the budding criminals meet up with Felix. The epitome of &#x201c;man,&#x201d; he is served well by the war. He exposes the teens to the lure of money, guns, and violence. Raised in a middle-class family, Giuliano<strong> </strong>struggles to fit in with his friends. Yet, he can&#x2019;t escape the nagging thought that it&#x2019;s not his war&#x2013;neither the physical fighting nor the one that his friends are launching against their lower-class lives. As Little Killer and Christian race toward their fate, the protagonist must decide who he is. Like Stassen&#x2019;s powerful Deogratias, a Tale of Rwanda (Roaring Brook, 2006), Gipi reveals the susceptible nature of teenagers during wartime. The oil drawings are tinged in gray, giving a sense of hopelessness as, years later, Giuliano<strong> </strong>doubts his decision. The all-male cast has sharp teeth and squinty eyes that reflect their rabid world. Teens won&#x2019;t rush toward this title but they should. It&#x2019;s both a warning and an inevitable story about a boy becoming a man under the most extreme conditions. Once they see themselves in Giuliano, they won&#x2019;t likely forget his memories.<em>&#x2013;Sadie Mattox, DeKalb County Public Library, Decatur, GA</em></p><p></p></p><h2>Steaming to Bamboola: The World of a Tramp Freighter</h2><p>Good condition book with dust jacket.

Beaton has written fourteen Hamish Macbeth mysteries. She is the author of the Agatha Raisin series and is a film commentator on BBC television. M. C. Beaton lives in a Cotswolds cottage with her husband.Taking a break from her two long-running series (Agatha Raisin and Hamish Macbeth), Beaton introduces a pair of engaging misfits whose struggles to cope with overbearing families and overweening circumstances teach them, eventually, to rely on each other. When diffident fortyish virgin Fellworth Dolphin's mother dies, he finds himself surprisingly relieved and freed from a bondage he was only partially aware of. That's nowhere near the astonishment he feels when he learns that, in spite of their penurious existence, he's heir to a large sum. In a moment of panic, when it seems an aunt might assume the tyrannical role his mother once played, Fell pretends an engagement to mousy waitress Maggie Partlett. In fits and starts, Maggie and Fell begin their separate transformations--she to a swan, he to a drake. One catalyst is the money and its questionable provenance--perhaps the result of an infamous train robbery that occurred many years ago and that Fell's father might have been involved with. The other is the transformation wrought by their shared investigation and their shared lives, as Maggie falls in with the pretended engagement for her own purposes. Various relatives and villains attempt to derail the couple as they journey, but there's never a question of where the author is taking her odd couple, and never a doubt they will arrive safely. The trip will delight fans of either of Beaton's other series.

Original. 15,000 first printing.</p><p><i>Vegetarian Express</i> claims that each of its recipes can be prepared in 28 minutes or less. If preparation time sometimes stretches to 40 minutes on a few of the more complicated recipes, it hardly matters, for you end up with an extraordinarily delicious, low-fat meal in as much time as it takes for the local pizza place to deliver one of its greasy pies. This book was written with busy people in mind: folks who like to eat well but don't have the time to spend steaming, blanching, soaking, and simmering after a full day of work. Instead, Nava Atlas and Lillian Kayte encourage cooks to use prepared foods as often as possible: canned chickpeas, frozen spinach, and quick-cook rice add up to a blissful curried chickpea stew; frozen corn, canned olives and tomatoes, and tortillas combine to make a dynamite Mexican lasagna. The book is divided into sections on grains, pastas, sandwiches, and more, including recipes for side dishes to compliment each entree. <p> Accompanying each recipe is a checklist for ingredients; a breakdown of the calories, grams of fat, and protein contained in each serving; and instructions for when to begin each phase of preparation. With <i>Vegetarian Express</i>, even the most harried cook can prepare healthful, tasty meals in record time.</p>Atlas (Vegetariana) and food writer Kayte serve up a slew of recipes for cooks who don't have time for the lengthy preparation often required by vegetarian dishes. The recipes, grouped in menus that help to minimize even the decision-making time, depend heavily on such "convenient foods" as canned beans, frozen vegetables, quick-cooking rice and packaged, pre-cut vegetables while making good use of tofu and pasta. Recipes come with nutritional analyses that sometimes require a second look: Vermicelli with Fresh Tomato and Basil Sauce, for example, has a per-serving calorie count of 177, but the recipe, intended for six, uses only 10 to 12 ounces of pasta, making for servings that are quite small. Of considerable appeal is the variety of menus in the chapter, Pizzas, Sandwiches, and Burgers, that are appropriate for lunch and provide a welcome respite from peanut butter; White Bean Pate is especially flavorful. There are some tasty recipes here, particularly for those with the leisure to substitute slightly less convenient ingredients. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Warriors of the Storm (The Last Kingdom Series, Book 9)</h2><p><p>The new novel in Bernard Cornwell&#x2019;s number one bestselling series on the making of England and the fate of his great hero, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.</p><p>BBC2&#x2019;s major Autumn 2015 TV show THE LAST KINGDOM is based on the first two books in the series.</p><p>A fragile peace is about to be broken...</p><p>King Alfred&#x2019;s son Edward and formidable daughter, �thelflaed, rule Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia.

She is resident teacher at Gampo Abbey in Nova Scotia, the first Tibetan monastery in North America established for Westerners. She is the author of many books and audiobooks, including the best-selling <i>When Things Fall Apart </i>and <i>Don't Bite the Hook</i>.Recently, some publishers have repackaged their bread-and-butter titles as gift boxes, pairing known bestsellers with certain extras (CDs, prayer flags, Tarot cards, etc.) and doubling the price. Rarely, however, has the strategy worked so seamlessly as it does in this gift collection from Chodron, Buddhist nun and author of the bestsellers When Things Fall Apart and The Places That Scare You. The pocket-sized book contained here, Start Where You Are, is nearly a decade old and is a popular primer on compassion-in-practice. In it, Chodron argues that to start where we are, we have to embrace our pain and learn how to live with it-and how to let it go. "It is unconditional compassion for ourselves that leads naturally to unconditional compassion for others," she writes, paraphrasing the lojong teachings that form the heart of the book. Lojong, meaning "mind training," consists of 59 "pithy slogans" about cultivating compassion. In addition to the book, this gift box contains 59 lojong cards with the teachings on one side and Chodron's commentary on the other. ("In all activities, train with slogans," says the ninth lojong card. It's advice that Chodron seems to have taken to heart.) The set comes with a little cardboard stand so that practitioners can prop a card in front of themselves during meditation, and it also offers a 43-minute CD with Chodron's spoken instructions on tonglen meditation-breathing in the suffering of others, and breathing out compassion. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>This Crazy Thing Called Love: The Golden World and Fatal Marriage of Ann and Billy Woodward</h2><p>An account of the murder of an heir to a banking fortune by his wife describes how a beautiful actress from impoverished rural Kansas won the love of banking heir Billy Woodward, only to shoot him in 1955 in their Oyster Bay home. 25,000 first printing. $25,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Braudy (What the Movies Made Me Do, 1985, etc.) sets out to do a background book on a high-society ``murder'' already addressed fictionally by Dominick Dunne in The Two Mrs. Grenvilles and Truman Capote in Answered Prayers--and finds herself defending the so- called murderess. Although Ann Woodward was never indicted for murdering her husband, William Woodward, Jr., his mother, Elsie, spread the rumor that Ann had deliberately killed Billy--and spread it first by insinuating that she herself had had the killing covered up for the sake of her grandsons. In Capote's vile version, Ann shot Billy in the shower, then dragged his body (with the butler's help) down the hall to the doorway of his bedroom. By the time Braudy finishes with the facts, there's no doubt that both Capote and Dunne were swimming in fantasy, that the death was an accident (Ann apparently thought that Billy was an intruder), and that Ann was victimized by the snobbery of the ultrarich, who exiled her after Billy's death. Braudy sticks to a weave of impressively fine detail taken from over a thousand interviews, though occasionally one wonders about her recording the inner thoughts of her fatal pair. But her cool drawing of the Woodwards' social background, their casual spending of immense sums, and their hobnobbing with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor is jaw-dropping. Ann, born to poor country folk in Kansas, chose early to better herself as a Powers model. She danced nights in an upscale Manhattan chorus line and was a respected radio actress by day when she met shy, virginal, playboy Billy. When married, their greatest claim to fame was their racing stable and fantastically fast horse, Nashua. Both were adulterers and engaged in rages before sex: What happened to them can be seen as the result of unrestrained immaturity. Hypnotic, though Braudy keeps a cool mask on her prose. (One hundred photographs.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In 1955, Ann Woodward shot her husband, Billy, in their Oyster Bay, Long Island, home. While she was cleared by a grand jury, which believed her story that she had mistaken Billy for a prowler who had been recently breaking into neighboring houses, New York society was convinced that she had deliberately murdered Billy and that her formidable mother-in-law, Elsie Woodward, had covered up the crime to prevent further scandal to the socially prominent family. The incident became fiction in Truman Capote's malicious 1975 Esquire story, leading to Ann's suicide, and later was the subject of Dominick Dunne's The Two Mrs. Grenvilles ( LJ 7/85). Now, after years of research, Braudy reveals the truth behind the legend. Tracing Ann's life from her difficult Kansas childhood through her early years as a model and aspiring actress to her stormy marriage to Billy Woodward and the sad years of her social exile after his death, Braudy shows how Ann, a victim of cruel gossip and class snobbery, could not have deliberately killed Billy.

Every day, it seems, we are warned about the harm producing and consuming meat can do to the environment and our bodies. Many of us have tried to limit how much meat we consume, and many of us have tried to give it up altogether. But it is not easy to resist the smoky, cured, barbequed, and fried delights that tempt us. What makes us crave animal protein, and what makes it so hard to give up? And if consuming meat is truly unhealthy for human beings, why didn't evolution turn us all into vegetarians in the first place?<br><br>In <i>Meathooked</i>, science writer Marta Zaraska explores what she calls the meat puzzle&#x201d;: our love of meat, despite its harmful effects. Zaraska takes us on a witty tour of meat cultures around the word, stopping in India's unusual steakhouses, animal sacrifices at temples in Benin, and labs in the Netherlands that grow meat in petri dishes. From the power of evolution to the influence of the meat lobby, and from our genetic makeup to the traditions of our foremothers, she reveals the interplay of forces that keep us hooked on animal protein.<br><br>A book for everyone from the diehard carnivore to the committed vegan, <i>Meathooked</i> illuminates one of the most enduring features of human civilization, ultimately shedding light on why meat-eating will continue to shape our bodies and our world into the foreseeable future.<br></p><p><b>Marta Zaraska</b> is a Polish-Canadian journalist whose science writing has appeared in <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i><i>Scientific American, </i>Newsweek</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>New Scientist</i>, among others.<strong>PRAISE FOR <em>MEATHOOKED</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes the secret is asking the right questions.

In her new book, Meathooked: The History and Science of Our 2.5-Million-Year Obsession with Meat, Polish-Canadian journalist Marta Zaraska (a conflicted mostly-vegetarian) explains why many crave an 8 oz. steak or a bucket of fried chicken with a vehemence that doesn&#x2019;t apply to, say, fresh kale.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;Psychology Today<br><br></strong>&#x201c;Where [other] books focus on whether we should eat meat, Zaraska is interested in why we still have the desire to eat meat, especially when we are flooded with so much information on how deleterious meat is on our health, our environment, and on the animals themselves...[Zaraska&#x2019;s] examination of the role of culture and tradition...resonates most deeply; from the tastes we absorb as fetuses to subtle clues from our parents, we are attuned to society&#x2019;s preferences, and for centuries, lots of meat has meant wealth and power.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;New Republic<br><br></strong>&#x201c;By exploring the juicy science behind this obsession and steering clear of activist dogma, Zaraska delivers a read that will satisfy vegans and carnivores alike.&#x201d;<br><strong>&#x2014;Mother Jones</strong><br></p><h2>Everyone Brave Is Forgiven</h2><p><p><b>The breathtaking new novel set during the Blitz by the bestselling and critically acclaimed author of the reader and bookseller favourite, <i>Little Bee</i>.</b><br><br>As World War Two begins,&nbsp;Mary, a young socialite, is determined to shock her blueblood political family by volunteering for the war effort.

Whatever it is, it made me approach Chris Cleave&#x2019;s <em>Everyone Brave is Forgiven</em> with a particularly wary eye. Sure, it&#x2019;s got all of the ingredients&#x2014;heroes and heroines who are flawed yet admirable. Check! A love story that manages to be poignant without being precious. Check! It even has cover art that is, as an astute colleague put it, a little cartoonish but appealingly &#x201c;Disney-London.&#x201d; If you&#x2019;re a terrible cook like me, however, you know that you can have all of the right ingredients and still concoct something utterly inedible. But this couldn&#x2019;t be farther from the case with &#x2018;Brave,&#x2019; which was inspired by love letters that Cleave unearthed from his grandparents. The non-love story aspects of this novel are just as compelling, and add a layer of gravitas to a story that could easily slip into &#x201c;sudsy&#x201d; territory. These parts provide a chilling reminder that it wasn&#x2019;t just the Jews who were marginalized and punished during WWII, but black children, poor children, and the otherwise &#x201c;different&#x201d; or disenfranchised. Moreover, through the character of Mary North, &#x2018;Brave&#x2019; emphasizes the importance of challenging injustices. This timeless message is another key ingredient in what is sure to be another beloved (WWII) novel. <em>--Erin Kodicek</em>CHRIS CLEAVE is a columnist for <i>The Guardian</i> in London.

To coincide with the show, the artist created several handmade books featuring a sampling of his work entitled <i>The Kids Are Alright</i>. A copy eventually found its way into the hands of Sylvia Wolf, then a curator of photography at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 2003, Wolf mounted an exhibition of his work at the venerable institution, the youngest artist to ever have a solo show at the museum.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What Wolf recognized&#x2014;and what other critics, curators, and collectors would quickly discover&#x2014;was an artist who understood and chronicled his own generation (habitu�es of New York City&#x2019;s downtown) as no artist had before him. McGinley had managed to capture the hedonistic adventures of youth culture&#x2014;kids hanging out and enjoying life&#x2014;but without the dark underbelly of earlier artists who mined similar themes. As the work evolved, he moved away from the more documentary aspect of the early photographs and began to create scenarios where he could explore different ideas (aesthetic and otherwise). This eventually led to the now legendary summer-long road trips, capturing groups of twenty-somethings amongst a variety of American landscapes. In his most recent body of work, McGinley continues to explore&#x2014;in black and white as well as in color&#x2014;the body but in the still, pared down atmosphere of his studio. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this first major monograph chronicling the entirety of the artist&#x2019;s career, McGinley&#x2019;s work is considered by three extraordinary figures: Chris Kraus, novelist and critic; John Kelsey, writer, artist and activist; and Gus Van Sant, the auteur filmmaker. Each attends&#x2014;through the lens of their own rich insights&#x2014;to various aspects of the artist&#x2019;s work and creative process, offering in-depth and unique perspectives on McGinley&#x2019;s work and import.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Chris Kraus</b> is the author of four novels, most recently <i>Summer of Hate</i> (2012) and two books of art criticism.

He lay propped against two pillows, the weight of his silvery head creasing the starched cases, his sunken face cast in stark relief against white linen. She took a steadying breath, repositioned the shoulder strap of her leather purse and pasted on a smile.<br><br>The click of her heels echoed as she walked toward the bed. She was glad she'd taken extra pains freshening up while she was at the house. Her collarless blazer and matching green skirt were crisp and wrinkle free. Keith would never know she hadn't eaten or slept since he'd been stricken yesterday.<br><br>"Dad. It's so good to see you awake." Mallory leaned over to kiss his cheek, holding her amber-colored hair back so it wouldn't trail in his face. As she straightened, she took his right hand in hers. His skin felt cold. The lack of response in his limp fingers shocked her. Until now, she hadn't realized how dearly she had come to love him, how big a part he played in her life now that they shared the same home. Keith was more a father to her than her own had ever been. "You're looking better already, you know? Some of your color's coming back."<br><br>A treacherous catch in her voice nearly betrayed her.<br><br>Why hadn't she recognized his prestroke symptoms? Any nurse worth her salt would have.<br><br>Spying tears slipping down his pallid cheeks, she gave him a careful hug. "Oh, Dad. We're through the worst, right? From here on in, you'll be amazed at how quickly you recover."<br><br>Keith's blue eyes followed her as she drew away. Was there something wrong here, something more than anxiety over his paralysis? She glanced at the monitor above his head. It seemed to her his heartbeat was too rapid, but she could detect no irregularities in the configurations. If the fast pulse were anything to be concerned about, the monitor alarm would be going off. Through the glass partition, she could see the ICU nurse sitting at the desk, her dark head bent as she filled out charts. Nothing out of the ordinary, apparently.<br><br>Pulling up a chair, Mallory eased her purse to the floor. Spittle ran from the corner of her father-in-law's mouth. Suddenly the nightmare of what had happened to him became a reality. She reached for a tissue and wiped his face, keeping her smile steady, her hands sure.<br><br>"Emily will come see you as soon as they move you to a regular room. She can't wait. She lost another tooth, but she won't put it under her pillow until you get home. Holding out for more money, I think. So much for believing in fairies, huh?" She laughed. The sound reminded her of two tin cans clanking. "She's staying with Beth Ham-stead until Mother and Dad get home. They're driving back from Texas immediately, but it'll take them an extra day. Dad lost the motor-home keys. Can you believe it? You remember Beth, the lady with all the little redheads?"<br><br>Keith's eyes clung to hers, frantic, pleading. His bottom lip quivered as he strained to speak. Spying a flutter of movement, she glanced over to see his left hand twitching, his fingers extended like claws. A low moan erupted from him.<br><br>"What is it?" She shot up from the chair. "Are you in pain?" The green graph line was rocketing across the monitor screen. He was clearly agitated about something. Her own pulse began to race as she grabbed the nurse buzzer. "There, there, it'll be okay. Relax, Dad. Take deep breaths."<br><br>The approaching swish of the nurse's polyester uniform eased the tension from Mallory's shoulders. She turned to watch the plump woman hurry to the bed.<br><br>"Problems?"<br><br></p><h2>The Beginner&#39;s Guide to Zen Buddhism</h2><p>Here is a comprehensive introduction to Zen Buddhism for those who don't know how or where to begin, nor what to expect once they have started practicing.

Mother held her all day and all night as if trying to will some of her strength into the little one so loved.</p> <p>Eily could feel tears at the back of her eyes. Sometimes she thought that maybe this was all a dream and soon she would wake up and laugh at it, but the hunger pain in her tummy and the sad ness in her heart were enough to know that it was real. She closed her eyes and remembered.</p> <p>It was hard to believe that it was only a little over a year ago, and they sitting in the old schoolroom, when Tim O'Kelly had run in to get his brother John and told them all to "Make a run home quick to help with lifting the spuds as a pestilence had fallen on the place and they were rotting in the ground." </p> <p>They all waited for the master to get his stick and shout at Tim: Away out of it, you fool, to disturb the learning, but were surprised when he shut his book and told them to make haste and "Mind, no dawdling," and "Away home to give a hand." They all ran so fast that their breath caught in their throats, half afraid of what they would find at home.</p> <p>Eily remembered. Father was sitting on the stone wall, his head in his hands. Mother was kneeling in the field, her hands and apron covered in mud as she pulled the potatoes from the ground, and all around the air heavy with a smell&#x2014;that smell, rot ting, horrible, up your nose, in your mouth. The smell of badness and disease.</p> <p>Across the valley the men cursed and the women prayed to God to save them. Field after field of potatoes had died and rotted in the ground. The crop, their food crop was gone. All the children stared&#x2014;eyes large and frightened, for even they knew that now the hunger would come. </p> <p>Eily snuggled up against Peggy's back and soon felt warmer. She was drowsy and finally drifted back to sleep.</p> <p>"Eily! Eily! Are you getting up?" whispered Peggy.<br> The girls began to stretch and after a while they threw off the blankets. Eily went over to the fire and put a sod of turf on the embers. The basket was nearly empty. That was a job<br> for Michael.</p> <p>Both girls went outside. The early morning sun was shining. The grass was damp with dew. They didn't delay as it was chilly in their shifts. Back in the cottage, Mother was still asleep and little Bridget dozed against her.<br> "Is there something to eat?"<br> "Oh, Michael, easy known you're up," jeered Eily.<br> "Go on, Eily, look, have a look," he pleaded.<br> "Away outside with you and wash that grime off your face and we'll see then."</p> <p>The sunlight peered in through the open cottage door. The place is dusty and dirty, thought Eily.</p> <p>The baby coughed and woke. Eily took her and sat in the fireside chair as Mother busied herself. There were three grayish leftover spuds. Mother sliced them and poured out a drink of skimmed milk from the large jug. It was little enough. No one spoke. They ate in silence, each with their own thoughts.</p> <p>Michael began to talk...to ask for...but changed his mind. Time had taught him a lesson.</p> <p>The first few times he had asked for more, his father or mother had lifted the wooden spoon and brought it down on the palm of his hand. Later, his pleas had been met by a sadness in his father's eyes and his mother bursting into tears. This he could not take on top of the pinches and squeezing of his two sisters. Things were better left unsaid.</p></p><h2>Complete Poems of Marianne Moore</h2><p>These are poems by Marianne Moore.</p><p>Critics And Connoisseurs<br> Animals Sick Of The Plague (fables, La Fontaine, Book 7, 1)<br> Apparition Of Splendor<br> Armor's Undermining Modesty<br> Arthur Mitchell<br> The Artic Ox<br> Avec Ardeur<br> Baseball And Writing<br> Bear And The Garden-lover (fables Of La Fontaine, Book 8,10)<br> Bird-witted<br> Blessed Is The Man<br> Blue Bug<br> Bowls<br> The Buffalo<br> By Disposition Of Angels<br> Camellia Sabina<br> The Camperdown Elm<br> Carnegie Hall: Rescued<br> A Carriage From Sweden<br> Charity Overcoming Envy<br> Combat Cultural<br> Dream<br> Efforts Of Affection<br> An Egyptian Pulled Glass Bottle In The Shape Of A Fish<br> Elephants<br> England<br> Enough<br> Enough<br> An Expedient -- Leonardo Da Vinci's -- And A Query<br> A Face<br> The Fish<br> For February 14th<br> Four Quartz Crystal Clocks<br> The Fox And The Grapes (fables Of La Fontaine, Book 3, 11)<br> The Frigate Pelican<br> Granite And Steel<br> A Grave<br> He Digesteth Harde Yron<br> He Wrote The History Book<br> The Hero<br> His Shield<br> Hometown Piece For Messrs.

He has worked at a variety f jobs, from theatrical fight choreographer to Emergency edical Technician. He resides in Portland, Oregon, with is wife and son, where he is currently at work on his next uspense novel, QUEEN AND COUNTRY, which Bantam ill publish in Spring 2004.Grade 7 Up&#x2014;Prior to DC Comics's revamp of its superhero universe in <i>Infinite Crisis</i>, a series of prelude miniseries were released to set up the larger conflicts that the central title would address. Despite the fact that each of these series&#x2014;including Greg Rucka's <i>The OMAC Project</i> and Gail Simone's <i>Villains United</i> (both 2006)&#x2014;ended abruptly and had a promised follow-up "special" yet to be published, they were collected in trade paperback. Unable to be included in the already-released trades or compiled with the massive <i>Infinite Crisis</i> collection, they appear in their semi-orphaned state in this book. The title is actually apt, but it doesn't make the effect any less jagged: the stories are clearly continuations of distant events, and they have only the most tenuous of internal connections. To use popular comic-universe terminology, they are a tangled mass of "continuity," helping to draw lines between other books, events, and situations. The varied artwork is quite good, and the stories are not without drama and effective moments, but this volume would be lost on casual readers; the characters are plentiful and the situations convoluted, as the massive cast of practically the entire superhero world shows up to be counted. As a supplement to collections that contain the previously mentioned titles, it would be welcome and quite useful, but it would be a mystifying morass if read on its own.&#x2014;<i>Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, NH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Guy Claxton&#x2019;s beautifully written book takes in intellectual and cultural history, literature, and spirituality. In <i>The Wayward Mind,</i> the common image of the mind is skillfully redrawn to acknowledge the constant influence of its invisible foundations on everyday human behavior.</p><p>The unconscious has had a long and chequered history. For at least the last 4,000 years, societies have concocted comforting fables in the face of the recurrent puzzles of human existence&#x2014;death, dreaming, madness, possession, inspiration&#x2014;that invariably rely on some notion of the unconscious. Supernatural "fairy stories" need some internal proxy or contact point through which the influence of demons and spirits can flow. And without such gods and forces, some psychological machinery is needed to take over their work. But what <i>is</i> the unconscious? Is it "God's viceroy," the soul? Is it the locked ward of Freudian desire? Is the subliminal mind the source of the sublime emotions of the Romantics? Is it the mental microchip of cognitive science? Or is it simply the brain?Guy Claxton is an internationally renowned writer, consultant, lecturer and academic specialising in creativity, education and the mind.

He&#39;s a palindrome. In fact, once he learns what a palindrome is, he starts finding palindromes everywhere: his little sis, Nan; his pup, Otto; even his Mom and Dad! It&#39;s making Bob feel like a kook. Is there no escape? Mark Shulman and Adam McCauley have joined forces to create a wonderfully visual, ridiculously clever book of wordplay. Join the hilarity. . . do your civic deed, don&#39;t let your pupils slip up, and find the over 101 palindromes hiding in the words and pictures of this zany book.</p><p>Madam, I&#39;m Adam McCauley is the author and illustrator of My Friend Chicken. He has also illustrated many other picture books and chapter books for children, including The Time Warp Trio series and Sideways Stories from Wayside School ."In this tale of compulsive wordplay, flame-haired Bob (aka Robert Trebor) discovers palindromes and becomes possessed by language. He notices mirror-image words and phrases everywhere, and begins listing "My kayak. My race car. Otto, my pup .... I needed to tell Mom and Dad and...O no!" Realizing the literal truth of the book title, Bob rushes to inform his sister Anna: "You're all palindromes! Even Nan!" Anna, snacking on Doofy Food, cautions, "Level, Bob, level. You're being a kook!" Bob's apprehension increases in a way that's both funny and infectious. "It will get better, won't it now -" he reasons, unwittingly compounding the irony. Shulman (<i>AA Is for Aardvark</i>) and McCauley (<i>My Friend Chicken</i>) mimic the high anxiety of Scieszka and Smith's <i>Math Curse</i>, down to the speckly illustration style and playful display type. They emphasize the palindromes with old-fashioned, circus-like capital letters that suit the hyper mood perfectly; street signs, book titles and incidental background details further reveal the palindrome epidemic.

Let's admit that there are many radicals who will not listen; their ears are closed, their hearts are hardened so nothing we say will make a difference. They have dismantled any bridges of communication with those who disagree with them, except to call them names. But there are others-perhaps a majority-who are in the homosexual lifestyle and would leave it if they thought they could. Their consciences are awakened to the wrongness of what they do, and yet they feel trapped. I believe that we as evangelicals have failed these people, many of whom populate our churches. As a pastor I've listened to their stories of brokenness and heartache. I've heard stories of molestation, of the emptiness of sex without commitment, without love, without caring. No matter what we see on television, the gay community is hurting, compulsively acting out behavior to cover their pain. These are the people for whom we must have compassion, understanding and care. It's a hurting world out there, and all of the wells are dry.&lt;br&gt;</p><h2>Aaron G. Green: Organic Architecture Beyond Frank Lloyd Wright</h2><p>Aaron G.

The fresh perspective that emerges removes the tale from its classical location on the Aegean shores of Asia Minor and moves it to the lost civilization described by Plato, a task Sora accomplishes with dramatic clarity and thought-provoking credibility.&#x201d; <br>--Frank Joseph, author of <em>The Destruction of Atlantis</em> <br> <br>In <em>The Triumph of the Sea Gods</em>, Steven Sora argues compellingly that Homer&#x2019;s tales do not describe adventures in the Mediterranean but are adaptations of pre-Celtic myths that chronicle an Atlantic coastal war that took place off the Iberian Peninsula around 1200 BCE. It was a war between Atlantean city-states that vied for power and trade along the Atlantic coast--a time when queens lost power to kings and goddesses were lorded over by gods. The resulting invasion of the Mediterranean by the Atlantean sea peoples brought destruction to the entire region, stretching eastward as far as Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. This was a turning point not only politically but also spiritually. The goddess became demonized, as seen in myths such as Pandora&#x2019;s Box, in which woman was seen as the source of evil not the origin of life, and Homer&#x2019;s tale of the epic Greek and Trojan war, which was triggered by the abduction of a woman. <br> <br>The actual historical struggle described in Homer&#x2019;s stories, Sora explains, occurred during what was the last in a series of rises in sea level that inundated various land masses (Atlantis) and permitted sea passage to areas previously accessible only by land. A powerful alliance of ancient sea peoples, most likely based near the Pillars of Hercules, attacked the tri-city region of Troia (Troy), near present-day Lisbon, which, shortly thereafter, fell victim to a devastating series of seaquakes and tsunamis. The war and the subsequent destructive weather broke the power of this seaboard civilization, leading to a wholesale invasion of the Mediterranean by the sea peoples and the rapid decline of the region&#x2019;s goddess-worshipping culture that had reigned there since Neolithic times.

Arguing that "Jesus of Nazareth as a historical man must be seen within Judaism," he examines the cultural and intellectual milieu in which Jesus lived. While this book originated in a series of scholarly lectures, technical language has been removed and footnotes simplified, making it eminently readable. Fascinating in its adroit use of sources little known to most laypersons, this should appeal to a wide audience. Joan W.

Everyone knows you can't wear a chicken on your head!<br><br>The prim little town of Littleton is in a tizzy preparing for a visit from the Queen. So when Miss Hunnicutt steps out in her new hat, the stuffy townsfolk are scandalized. The chicken has to go! But plucky Miss Hunnicut stands up for her right to wear what she likes. And when the Queen's arrival prompts a surprising turn of events, the townspeople learn to celebrate the silly eccentricities that make life interesting.<br></p><p>JEFF BRUMBEAU grew up in New York City, where he lived with his mother and sister in his widowed grandmother&#39;s house. Inspired by self-sufficient women, Jeff believes, that it later inspired him to write children&#39;s books, The Man-In-The-Moon in Love and The Quiltmaker&#39;s Gift. Jeff lives in Chicago and Taos with Marcia, his wife; Samantha, the opera-singing Persian cat; and Louis, the daredevil alley cat.Kindergarten-Grade 3-When residents of Littleton receive word that the Queen might stop by, they engage in a flurry of activity to beautify the town. Perfectionists all, they cannot bear it when Miss Hunnicutt appears wearing her new hat, complete with a live chicken, perched on top of her head. "It has to go!" is the general consensus. But the woman stands her ground, creating chaos all around her as distracted citizens allow cats to escape up a tree and leave water running, causing a mudslide that coats streets and people alike; and trucks carrying the royal cake and raspberry soda collide, scattering their contents everywhere. Just when things can't get any worse, the monarch arrives, sporting a surprise of her own. Brumbeau's lengthy text reveals an increasingly confident Miss Hunnicutt who first says in a tiny voice: "I think I might have the right to wear what I like"; then states firmly: "I'm pretty sure I have the right to wear what I like"; and finally asserts in a voice "both loud and sure": "I have the right to wear what I like!" The watercolor illustrations are large and extremely busy, reflecting the copious beautifying activities and subsequent pandemonium. Cats wearing funny hats are everywhere. Mud-splattered townsfolk tumble across spreads, while falling strawberries and soda cover everything. Beneath the book's jacket is a panoramic view of Littleton and readers can hunt for all 27 of Miss Bisbee's cats. Endpapers filled with outlandish hats and many visual jokes will keep youngsters amused for some time.<br><i>Marianne Saccardi, Norwalk Community College, CT</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Memory and Legacy: The Shoah Narrative of the Illinois Holocaust Museum</h2><p>Richly illustrated and amply documented, Memories and Legacy is a compelling presentation of the epoch-making events of the Holocaust that will intrigue and inform students and seasoned readers alike. Beginning before the rise of Nazism, the narrative progresses through Kristallnacht and ghettoization, through mass executions and the Final Solution, and finally to liberation and the re-creation of shattered lives. Particular attention is paid to how many Jews acted to defy hate with humanity, and how they shaped their lives within the shadow of impending death. Throughout the book, Holocaust survivors who settled in the Chicago area share with us their voices, photographs, and artifacts. These survivors act as our guides to the unprecedented catastrophe and to the task of bearing witness.</p><p></p><h2>Cosmic Voyage: True Evidence of Extraterrestrials Visiting Earth</h2><p>A professor at Emory University offers evidence that extraterrestrials have visited and are living on Earth, and recounts his own communication with a distant galactic federation of extraterrestrial civilizations.

When they grow up they'd like to be "artists-in-residence at a nudist colony." If youthful voyeurism figures heavily in their everyday lives, so, too, do the pleasures of analogy, metaphor, and deliberate misprision. Sauntering into one store that dares to call itself MAN SHOP, Toni demands: "One man and two small boys, please." <p> Julian Barnes could probably fill several books with these boys' clever misadventures, but in his first novel he attempts something more daring--the curve from youthful scorn to adult contentment. In 1968, when Chris goes off to Paris, he misses the May <i>�v�nements</i> but manages, more importantly, to fall in love and learn the pleasures of openness: "The key to Annick's candour was that there was no key. It was like the atom bomb: the secret is that there is no secret." The final section finds Chris back in suburbia, married, with children and a mortgage, and slowly accepting the surprise that happiness isn't boring. "It's certainly ironic to be back in Metroland. As a boy, what would I have called it: <i>le syphilis de l'�me</i>, or something like that, I dare say. But isn't part of growing up being able to ride irony without being thrown?" Far from renouncing the joys of language, this novel wittily celebrates honest communication. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>&#34;Barnes writes like a dream.&#34; --Village Voice Literary Supplement</p><h2>France: A Modern History from the Revolution to the War with Terror</h2><p><p>With the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, the next two centuries for France would be tumultuous. Critically acclaimed historian and political commentator Jonathan Fenby provides an expert and riveting journey through this period as he recounts and analyzes the extraordinary sequence of events of this period from the end of the First Revolution through two others, a return of Empire, three catastrophic wars with Germany, periods of stability and hope interspersed with years of uncertainty and high tensions. </p><p>As her cross-channel neighbor Great Britain would equally suffer, France was to undergo the wrenching loss of colonies in the post-Second World War era as the new modern world we know today took shape. Her attempts to become the leader of the European union was a constant struggle, as was her lack of support for America in the two Gulf Wars of the past twenty years. Alongside this came huge social changes and cultural landmarks, but also fundamental questioning of what this nation, which considers itself exceptional, really stood&#x2015;and stands&#x2015;for. That saga and those questions permeate the France of today, now with an implacable enemy to face in the form of Islamic extremism which so bloodily announced itself this year in Paris. Fenby will detail every event, every struggle, and every outcome across this expanse of 200 years. It will prove to be the definitive guide to understanding France.</p></p><p>JONATHAN FENBY is a former editor of the UK <i>Observer</i> and of the <i>South China Morning Post</i>. He is the author of several books including the acclaimed<i> The General: Charles de Gaulle and the France He Saved </i>and <i>Chiang Kai-shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost</i>. In 2013 Jonathan was awarded the Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur by the French government for his contribution towards understanding between Britain and France.<p>"Well narrated...Mr. Fenby is a commonsensical yet sensitive analyst...a useful compendium of France's failed political responses to its stunningly fractious history since 1789." - <i><b>Wall Street Journal</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;Quelle histoire!...

Grant: Triumph over Adversity, 1822-1865 (Military Classics)</h2><p><p>Many modern historians have painted Ulysses S. Grant as a butcher, a drunk, and a failure as president. Others have argued the exact opposite and portray him with saintlike levels of ethic and intellect.</p><p>In <i>Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph over Adversity 1822&#x2013;1865</i>, historian Brooks D. Simpson takes neither approach, recognizing Grant as a complex and human figure with human faults, strengths, and motivations. Simpson offers a balanced and complete study of Grant from birth to the end of the Civil War, with particular emphasis on his military career and family life and the struggles he overcame in his unlikely rise from unremarkable beginnings to his later fame as commander of the Union Army. Chosen as a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book upon its original publication, <i>Ulysses S. Grant</i> is a readable, thoroughly researched portrait that sheds light on this controversial figure.</p></p><p>Brooks D. Simpson is an American historian and writer who is currently ASU Foundation Professor of History at Arizona State University. He is best known for his work on Ulysses S. Grant but has written on topics from George Washington&#39;s Supreme Court appointments to baseball great Derek Jeter. His book Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph over Adversity, 1822-1865 was named a New York Times Notable Book and a Choice Outstanding Academic Title. Simpson has appeared several times on C-SPAN, speaking on Grant and Henry Adams, as well as on PBS&#39;s American Experience.cwcrossroads.wordpress.com<p>"Serving as neither his subject's advocate nor his prosecutor, Arizona State University historian Simpson provides an eminently informed and finely balanced portrait of Ulysses S. Grant as man, husband, failed entrepreneur and shrewd, victorious general. Simpson (<i>Let Us Have Peace: Ulysses S. Grant and the Politics of War and Reconstruction, 1861&#x2013;1868) </i>uses carefully excavated facts and anecdotes to reveal an individual far more complex than the caricature (drunken, barbarous in battle, corrupt when given opportunity) handed down to us by popular history. At the same time, Simpson does not gloss over Grant's shortcomings. Although a fan of the general's, Simpson is not in the business of writing apologetics, and therein lies his strength."</p><p>?"<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (History Book Cub main selection)</p><br><br><p>"Why, given the existence of so many other studies about the man and his times, would anyone want to read this lengthy biography? Because it is skillfully written; because Grant's life is more fully realized in it than in previous one-volume studies; and because Simpson, who has benefited from decades of Civil War study, wears his wide-ranging scholarship lightly. Guaranteed to enlighten and please anyone who hasn't had enough of the Civil War and its central figures."</p><p>?"<i>Kirkus</i></p><br><br><p>"This is the best study of Grant's military career since Bruce Catton's two volumes; and on many matters it exceeds Catton, as a consequence of the immense amount of Civil War scholarship during the past thirty years, which Simpson has thoroughly mastered.

He does it well. He plays professional football with the Los Angeles Raiders in the fall. He does that well. In his spare time, he does television commercials for Nike and other organizations. Now, this dynamic young man has written his autobiography, and has done it well. This is a fast-paced book with snappy dialogue, written in a frank, open, and honest style. Jackson minces no words about how he feels about people and events. He tells readers he was the bad Jackson kid who got himself turned around and made a success of his life. His love of family, his own and others, permeates the book. The language is street level; this is how Jackson talks. He is current news, and considering all the sports records he is breaking, his name will be news for a long time. Students reluctant to read will pick up this book.

Here, writing with Schaap ( Instant Replay ), he tells of his rise from grinding poverty as one of 10 children in a fatherless Alabama family; he was often hungry and given to extorting money from schoolmates. Athletics were Jackson's salvation: he starred in track and field in high school, then in football at Alabama's Auburn University, where he won the prestigious Heisman trophy.

These two hundred poems, bound together in this collection, draw upon both Afghan tradition and the nation's recent past, and seamlessly connect with the long history of Persian, Urdu, and Pashto verse. The contrast between the severity of the Taliban's ideology and its long-standing poetic tradition is nothing short of remarkable. Unrequited love, vengeance, the thrill of battle, religion, and nationalism -- even a yearning for nonviolence -- are expressed through images of wine, powerful women, and pastoral beauty, providing a fascinating perspective on the hearts and minds of Western civilization's redoubtable adversaries. </p><p>Whether they are describing a wedding party annihilated by an air strike or lamenting, "we did all of this to ourselves," these poems are concerned not with politics but with identity and a full, textured, and deeply conflicted humanity. Such impassioned works -- defeated, enraged, triumphant, bitterly powerless, and bitingly satirical -- ultimately endure as a record of the war in Afghanistan. Two introductory essays contextualize the anthology's poems, relating their significance to Pashtun history and their reflection of a culture inundated by thirty years of war. Faisal Devji, noted Taliban scholar, underscores the link between these poems and the Taliban's emotional and ethical character in a preface.</p></p><p><p>Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn are researchers and writers who have worked in Afghanistan since 2006.

This extraordinary collection is remarkable as a literary project -- uncovering a seam of war poetry few will know ever existed. Yet it is also an important political project, humanizing and giving voice to the aspirations, aesthetics, emotions, and dreams of the fighters of a much-caricatured and little-understood resistance movement about to defeat yet another foreign occupation.</p> (William Dalymple, author of <i>The Return of a King: Sha Shuja and the First Battle for Afghanistan, 1839--42 </i>)<br><br><p>By turns angry, idealistic, or cynically witty, these Taliban poets can leave none unmoved by verse that conjures up Persian metaphysics, Muslim traditions, and a Pashtun quest for honor. Indeed, as triumphs and ruination test these mujahedeens' faith in God, some even echo the shock, sense of betrayal. and despair of Britain's First World War poets.</p> (Hugh Pope, author of <i>Dining with al-Qaeda: Three Decades Exploring the Many Worlds of the Middle East</i>)<br><br><p>These poems of love, war, and friendship tell us more about Afghanistan than a million news reports.

In <i>Poetry of the Taliban</i>, we see that within the movement there are warriors with wounded hearts, lyrical souls, and a passionate love for language and ideas.</p> (Jon Lee Anderson, author of <i>The Lion's Grave: Dispatches from Afghanistan</i>)<br><br><p>A highly original and extremely important book that sheds more light on the Taliban and its resilience than any organizational chart or force assessment. It draws attention to the crucial role aesthetics and emotions -- as opposed to resources and doctrines -- play in military organizations. As such, this may be the first poetry book of strategic significance.</p> (Thomas Hegghammer, author of <i>Jihad in Saudi Arabia: Violence and Pan-Islamism Since 1979</i>)<br><br><p>An essential work. In compiling the poetry of the Taliban, these young scholars have preserved the intimate and the expansive, ranging from pastoral imagery of the Afghan countryside to satire on global politics and rich references to Afghan, Muslim, and biblical history. In the process, they go beyond humanizing the Taliban toward understanding them. A Taliban the world knows as culturally backward have in fact inspired a corpus of poetry reflecting the finest accomplishments of Pashto, Farsi, Urdu, and Arabic civilizations. If anyone still wonders which cultural resources the Taliban drew on to inspire a people to resist a dull global plan to modernize them, read on.</p> (Michael Semple, Harvard University, former European Union representative in Afghanistan)<br><br><p>The most shocking emotion the book inspires isn't fellow feeling with the butchers of Afghanistan; it is delight. The pleasure of <i>Poetry of the Taliban</i> is its most upsetting feature.... Such poetry is profoundly revealing of the psychology of our enemy. Culled from cellphones, websites and cassettes, the <i>Poetry of the Taliban</i> bears little, if any, relation to official al-Qaeda "literature" with its idiotic, dull, unreadably boring dogmatism. There is politics in this collection but little ideology, little talk even of Islam. The verse burns with immediacy of reality. It's full of alternately witty and grotesque bragging.... The publication of this anthology is as depressing as it is revelatory. <i>Poetry of the Taliban</i> is a celebration of indestructible despair, of unending destruction and resurgent beauty. It is as harrowing a portrait of Afghanistan as any piece of reporting I have read.</p> (Stephen Marche <i>Maclean's</i>)<br><br><p>A welcome addition to the growing, largely non-fiction, archive about the Taliban.

Xuela Claudette Richardson, daughter of a Carib mother and a half-Scottish, half-African father, grows up in a harsh, loveless world after her mother dies in childbirth. Xuela&#x2019;s narrative provides a rich, vivid exploration of the Caribbean and the pervasive influence of colonialism. <b>The Autobiography of My Mother</b> is a story of love, fear, loss, and the forging of a character, an account of one woman's inexorable evolution evoked in startling and magical poetry.</p><p>&#34;My mother died at the moment I was born, and so for my whole life there was nothing standing between myself and eternity,&#34; writes Jamaica Kincaid in this disturbing, compelling novel set on the island of Dominica. Born to a doomed Carib woman and a Scottish African policeman of increasing swagger and wealth, narrator Xuela spends a lifetime unanchored by family or love. She disdains the web of small and big lies that link others, allowing only pungent, earthy sensuality--a mix of blood and dirt and sex--to move her. Even answering its siren call, though, Xuela never loses sight of the sharp loss that launched her into the world and the doors through which she will take her leave.In a life not unlike those she writes about, Elaine Potter Richardson was born and raised on Antigua, a tiny island in the West Indies. Single-handedly raised by her struggling mother, she never knew her biological father. Brought up on a colonized island, Kincaid grew to harbor contempt toward the British regime, leery of the control they had. Having grown distant from her mother, she left home at 17 to become an au pair in New York, dyed her hair blonde, and changed her name to Jamaica Kincaid. She broke off all contact with her mother, took photography classes at the New School and made new friends. A few years later she entered the literary world with her first published article in <i>Ingenue</i>, an interview of Gloria Steinem. This led to her writing music critiques for the <i>Village Voice</i>. While accompanying a friend, George W.S. Trow, as he researched pieces for the <i>New Yorker </i>column "Talk of the Town," she started taking notes on events in the city. Trow passed her notes on to William Shawn, then the editor of the <i>New Yorker</i>, who spotted her talent and decided to print the notes as a piece. He went on to publish her first piece of fiction, an emotionally intense one-page monologue called "Girl," in 1978. A year later, Kincaid married his son Allen Shawn, a composer. She continued to write for the New Yorker until recently, when she left, unhappy with changes brought on by the new editor. Her first collection, <i>At the Bottom of the River</i>, was published in 1983, and soon after she began gaining a following as one of the decade's most notable new writers.<br><br>Often compared to other prominent authors such as Toni Morrison and V.S. Naipaul, Kincaid has continued to successfully produce acclaimed pieces of work, winning over critics and audiences alike. <i>At the Bottom of the River</i> received the Morton Dauwen Zabel Award of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and was nominated for the PEN/Faulkner Award. In 1985 she published <i>Annie John, </i>introducing readers to her unique and luminous prose that has set her apart from other novelists. <i>A Small Place</i>(1988) and <i>Lucy</i> (1991) followed shortly after. <i>The Autobiography of My Mother</i>, which took Kincaid five years to write, has received wide recognition, shooting to bestseller lists across the country, and is regarded as her finest novel yet. When Kincaid is not busy raising her two children or obsessing in her garden, her favorite pastime, she is teaching both fiction writing and English at Harvard one semester a year.<br><br>Kincaid has risen from an economic and racially challenged childhood to one of the most revered writers of our time. Using her experience and passion, she writes moving and unsettling stories about human suffering, politics, power, and the relationships tying them together. She has said that she writes "to make sense of it all" to herself, not directing her work at anyone in particular. No matter, Kincaid's contribution to the literary world will no doubt have an everlasting effect on those who read her work.</p><h2>Cooking without a kitchen</h2><p>&#34;How to create distinctive food in a small apartment or outdoors.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Artisan Jewish Deli at Home</h2><p>For Jewish deli devotees and DIY food fanatics alike, <i>The Artisan Jewish Deli at Home</i> is a must-have collection of over 100 recipes for creating timeless deli classics, modern twists on old ideas and innovations to shock your Old Country elders.

Circumstances force him to accept a mysterious job as shuttle pilot for billionaire Morgan Goldstein, who's plotting to corner trade with the alien hjadd.

A true pioneer of this technique and schooled by Joseph Pilates&#x2019; original prot�g�, Siler lives in New York City with her husband and son.</p><b>Welcome to Your Ultimate Pilates Body� Challenge!</b><br>As many of you know, Pilates is one of those wonderful phenomena that has broken through the surface of the collective consciousness in the last few years to emerge as a "hot new trend." Fewer people realize that Pilates brings almost one hundred years of history with it.<br><br>Created by Joseph H. Pilates to strengthen his frail and sickly body, Pilates was then translated to specific apparatus to help those unable to support their own body weight. It debuted in 1920s New York City as the lengthening, strengthening, and rehabilitation secret of stars, starlets, dancers, and acrobats and then all but disappeared for the next few decades, remaining known only to the small population interested in physical fitness. Today that demographic extends to include most everyone looking for strong, long, lean muscles, inspired either by the media culture or touched by an injury.<br><br>Dressed up or dressed down, at the core of the Pilates movement today still beats the heart of the Pilates of yesteryear. Designed to use the art and science of muscle control--what Joseph Pilates termed <i>Contrology</i>--to help you achieve the body that looks good, feels good, and sustains you for a lifetime, Pilates is ageless, colorless, and genderless; and once incorporated into your subconscious, it marries the joy of movement with the efficiency of your most challenging workout.<br>Correctly executed and mastered to the point of subconscious reaction, these exercises will reflect grace and balance in your routine activities. Contrology exercises build a sturdy body and sound mind capable of performing everyday tasks with ease and perfection. They also provide tremendous reserve energy for sports, recreation and emergencies.<br>(<i>Return to Life through Contrology</i>, Joseph H. Pilates)<br>Many of you are old friends, readers I know from <i>The Pilates Body</i>. I hope, too, many of you are new friends, readers who have picked up <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i> because you are intrigued by expanding your awareness and your body's potential. And, finally, welcome to the reader who is not yet in shape--or who was in shape and is somehow, now, mysteriously, feeling as if he or she were living in someone else's body, because I can relate! Halfway through the writing of this book, I had a baby--and suddenly became my own audience. So, as I wrote and rewrote, read and reread this book's philosophy I also relived the work from the ground up.<br><br>I began writing <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i> before I was pregnant. Why? Because I was seeing what I felt was an alarming trend. Every day I had clients coming in and doing amazing work, then abandoning basic posture and alignment before they got to the sidewalk. I began to do some research. What I discovered was a twofold problem: Clients were stagnating within their solo workout sessions, and they weren't applying what they had learned in the studio when they were off the mat. Off the mat? Yes. Because Pilates is more than the exercises performed in a studio. It's about personal responsibility, active self-care, and feeling good as you move through your day and your life. More than a series of movements, it's a philosophy and a mind-set. Because, if your brain is not active and engaged and working, it won't matter how good you look; you won't feel your best. Without your conscious brain, your body is like any piece of equipment without an owner's manual. Usable, but too often a mystery.<br><br>And, as I said, I understand that feeling of mystery! After having my beautiful baby, I discovered that even though I had been physically fit, and educated, my body had become a mystery. Although I knew intellectually where I should be lifting from and which muscles I should be engaging, the communication lines between my brain and my body appeared to have been disconnected. I needed to reread the owner's manual. So, <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i> became that manual. <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i> asks you to take a real look at your body--beyond the number that appears on the scale. Can you discover why you've hit a plateau within your workout? Why you always end up with knee pain? Why your neck feels strained at the end of the day?<br><br>I want you to get moving--and have fun and<i> be efficient </i>while doing what you do. One thing I've learned as a new mom is that time is of the essence; I needed to get more out of less time. <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i> is full of both new mat routines and ways to take what you've learned in the studio off the mat and into the world with Pilates Interval Training at the Gym, the Invisible Workout&#x2122;, and Pilates for the Sports Minded.<br>People need three things out of their fitness programs:<br><br>* Strength<br>* Flexibility<br>* Cardiovascular conditioning<br>Pilates has all three! Too often, however, it is thought of as a system that is specific to dancers, rehabilitation, or meditation.<br><br>I wrote <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i> to help Pilates beat this rap, to change the perception that Pilates is limited to an arena outside your daily scope of living or working out. Like many of you, I am busy multitasking the many matters that make up my day-to-day life; and when I am ready, willing, and able to work out, it can't be so complicated as to put me off, so boring as to not challenge me, or so ineffectual as to waste my precious time. With those principles in mind, I put together the building blocks of Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge so that they can be stacked and moved around as best suit your needs.<br><br>With the principles you'll find in Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge, those of you just beginning can create a safe, challenging, and efficient workout, and those of you who have become bored with your routine can infuse an old workout with renewed energy and purpose. Interval challenges are included to enhance your cardiovascular output and help burn more calories and dissolve fat.<br><br>When you're in the gym, I'll teach you to use your Pilates principles to turn a stale workout routine into a fat-burning, muscle-producing, <i>efficient</i> use of your time. No more plugging away for hours on the same old course, stomping up the same hills, or hanging over the same handlebars.<br><br>As a self-confessed gym junkie, I was compelled to create the Pilates-Conscious Cardio Circuit. Armed with the information in <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i>, you will be able to complete a Pilates-aware circuit at the gym on a variety of machines that will burn more calories in less time. Once you have completed the circuit, you can hit your mat for a 10- to 20-minute Pilates mat routine while your heart is still pumping in the target zone. Fast, fun, and extremely challenging the Pilates-Conscious Cardio Circuit is a high-powered, superconscious workout that engages you both mentally and physically.<br><br>For my fellow die-hard Pilates Matwork fans <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i> is chock full of new movements, engaging visual and verbal metaphors, tips to progress or modify your matwork, and four fantastic body-specific programs. Adding Abs, Lean Lower Body, Perfecting Posture, and Finding Flexibility contain both the fun and the challenges you need to target your main areas of concern while still giving yourself a total-body workout.<br><br>Athletes and sports fans alike will gain insight into their game from the information in the sports section. Here, I took the principles of Pilates and applied them to four of the sports so many of us know and love: tennis, golf, skiing, and snowboarding. As you begin to incorporate this information, you'll add depth and proficiency to your game. Every great athlete must combine artistry with technique, form with function. Pilates is steeped in the art and science of body movement/physiology and a few great visual cues or Pilates form tips can be the difference between good and great when it counts. Whatever your sport of choice is, the guidelines of this section apply.<br><br>But what about the days when you can't get to the gym or hit the courts, the course, or the slopes? Unique to <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i> is my Invisible Workout, which will serve to keep you tuned in and toned up throughout the day by using simple Pilates-conscious moves that you can execute anywhere and everywhere. Whether a handbag or a hand weight, a child or a chest press--the Invisible Workout will teach you to use the world around you as a tool for improving your fitness and physique.<br><br>The Invisible Workout helps you incorporate basic Pilates principles into your daily activities, making the world your gym as well as your oyster. Before my son was born, I had the misguided assumption that I would snap back into shape with little to no effort at all. My Pilates practice served me incredibly well throughout the entire pregnancy, and there was no reason to believe anything but a miraculous recovery was in store. What a rude awakening to discover that my body had a different game plan. I am thankful I had <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i> to work on. Every activity and movement in my daily life became another chance to regain my strength and control over my body. Although they seemed like baby steps at times, they added up to more.<br><br>The Invisible Workout asks if you can learn to apply the fundamentals of Pilates to real-life situations. For everything from taking out the garbage to sinking a hole-in-one. What will it mean when you can? It will mean you will be working your body naturally throughout the entire day, instead of working your body inefficiently for 1 or 2 hours every other day at the gym. Becoming observant, training the body from the inside out, beginning to rely on its deepest muscles to sit and stand and walk properly, means not only carrying and lifting but running, skating, swimming . . . all your favorite activities begin to flow with ease and efficiency.

Born in India as Dora Amy Elles, she began writing after the death of her first husband, publishing her first novel in 1910. In the 1920s, she introduced the character who would make her famous: Miss Maud Silver, the former governess whose stout figure, fondness for Tennyson, and passion for knitting served to disguise a keen intellect. Along with Agatha Christie&#x2019;s Miss Marple, Miss Silver is the definitive embodiment of the English style of cozy mysteries.&#x201c;Miss Silver has her place in detective fiction as surely as Lord Peter Wimsey or Hercule Poirot.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Manchester Evening News </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Patricia Wentworth has created a great detective in Miss Silver, the little old lady who nobody notices, but who in turn notices everything.&#x201d; &#x2014;Paula Gosling, author of the Jack Stryker mystery series&nbsp;&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t go wrong with Miss Maud Silver.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Observer</i></p><h2>Lambs of God</h2><p>Three devout nuns living in a crumbling monastery on a remote island are simultaneously attracted to and resentful of an ambitious priest who arrives to survey their land for the site of a spa for the wealthy. 22,500 first printing.</p><p><b>Marele Day</b> is well known in her native Australia as the author of several successful crime novels, as well as short stories and poems.A man intrudes on an all but extinct order of pastoral nuns in this intriguing but heavy-handed parable from Australian crime-novelist Day. Sisters Iphigenia, Margarita and Carla live in a ruined monastery on a remote Australian island, tending their only flock: the Agnes sisters, sheep named for nuns who have died. The rhythm of life is seasonal and canonical: washing day, shearing day, Christmas, Lent. It's hard to say what year it is... until Father Ignatius arrives with a cellular phone to assess what he thought was abandoned property. A career churchman, Ignatius wants to turn a profit by transforming the forgotten nunnery into a luxury retreat for businessmen. The story takes a Stephen King turn when the nuns realize that the priest's plans threaten them. Ignatius is drugged with herbal tea, stripped, shaved and plastered up to the waist in a cast. Still, the priest's presence provokes different reactions from each nun, stirring up long-dormant secrets that threaten to tear apart their community. Ignatius himself undergoes something more than a physical transformation as he is forced to reassess the meaning of his mission in the church. Although Day has undeniable storytelling gifts and weaves together an impressive number of storytelling traditions (classical, biblical, Celtic and fairy tale), the novel's rather kitschy setup and often gruesomely graphic feminist symbolism may force even sympathetic readers to share Ignatius's feeling that "There were parts of the story that even he was having trouble swallowing."

It introduces a parade of champions and their spectacular supporting characters.</p><p>Here, for the first time, is the story of how America&#39;s first national resort gave birth to, then nurtured, its first national sport, introducing the country to a parade of champions and their spectacular supporting characters. To experience this adventure is to see why the Saratoga Race Course, America&#39;s oldest major sports facility remains one of its most beloved and most successful. They&#39;re Off! is as much a social history as it is sports history. Edward Hotaling opens with a little-known visit by the first famous tourist, George Washington, who tried to buy the place he called &#34;the Saratoga Springs&#34;. Soon the pursuit of happiness at our original vacationland helped redefine America. Even at the height of the Civil War, the country&#39;s first organized sport was launched on a national scale.The first thoroughbred race in the U.S. was held at Saratoga Springs in 1847, and the first national thoroughbred race took place there during the Civil War, when the upstate New York town began to establish itself as the country's prime resort. Throughout the Gilded Age, Saratoga lured Astors, Vanderbilts, Belmonts and other millionaires and became known for its huge and lavish hotels, its gambling houses and, very incidentally, its restorative waters. Its 42-day season was short, but it still lured the top horses for flat and harness racing and even steeplechasing. Among the great mounts that raced there for the Travers Stakes, begun in 1864, or the Saratoga Cup, started a year later, were Longfellow, probably the best thoroughbred of the 19th century, Man o' War, who suffered his only loss there, Whirlaway and Secretariat. Saratoga's two-legged visitors included presidents and gangsters, writers and movie stars. Television director and scriptwriter Hotaling tells its exciting story well, and the 95 illustrations are worthy of the text. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sally Mann: Immediate Family</h2><p>First published in 1992, <i>Immediate Family</i> has been lauded by critics as one of the great photography books of our time, and among the most influential. Taken against the Arcadian backdrop of her woodland summer home in Virginia, Sally Mann's extraordinary, intimate photographs of her children reveal truths that embody the individuality of her own family yet ultimately take on a universal quality. With sublime dignity, acute wit and feral grace, Sally Mann's pictures explore the eternal struggle between the child's simultaneous dependence and quest for autonomy&#x2014;the holding on and the breaking away.

Her tale, though an exploration of extremity, is highly readable and warm."--</b><b><i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><b></b><br><b>A riveting memoir of losing faith and finding freedom while a covert missionary in one of the world's most restrictive countries.</b></b><br><br>A third-generation Jehovah's Witness, Amber Scorah had devoted her life to sounding God's warning of impending Armageddon. She volunteered to take the message to China, where the preaching she did was illegal and could result in her expulsion or worse. Here, she had some distance from her community for the first time. Immersion in a foreign language and culture--and a whole new way of thinking--turned her world upside down, and eventually led her to lose all that she had been sure was true.<br><br>As a proselytizer in Shanghai, using fake names and secret codes to evade the authorities' notice, Scorah discreetly looked for targets in public parks and stores. To support herself, she found work at a Chinese language learning podcast, hiding her real purpose from her coworkers. Now with a creative outlet, getting to know worldly people for the first time, she began to understand that there were other ways of seeing the world and living a fulfilling life. When one of these relationships became an "escape hatch," Scorah's loss of faith culminated in her own personal apocalypse, the only kind of ending possible for a Jehovah's Witness.<br><br>Shunned by family and friends as an apostate, Scorah was alone in Shanghai and thrown into a world she had only known from the periphery--with no education or support system. A coming of age story of a woman already in her thirties, this unforgettable memoir examines what it's like to start one's life over again with an entirely new identity. It follows Scorah to New York City, where a personal tragedy forces her to look for new ways to find meaning in the absence of religion. With compelling, spare prose, <i>Leaving the Witness</i> traces the bittersweet process of starting over, when everything one's life was built around is gone.</p><p>Amber Scorah is a writer living in Brooklyn, NY. Her articles have been published in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Believer</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>. Prior to coming to New York, Scorah lived in Shanghai, where she was creator and host of the podcast <i>Dear Amber - The Insider's Guide to Everything China</i>. This is her first book.The first thing I saw when I arrived in Shanghai was a fight on the street. People had extracted themselves from the masses on all sides to watch, standing like awkward party guests. Cyclists held up their black bicycles by the handlebars, pedestrians dallied, their hands full of thin plastic bags from the market. As the momentum of the city pushed against those who were stationary, people spilled over onto the street, like water around rocks. Our taxi driver slowed the car to look.<br><br>In the center of the crowd, a man and a woman were arguing. The people who had paused to take in this (as I would come to learn) common spectacle were silent as the parties involved shouted, laying out their dispute. No fist was raised&#x2014;�though fights on the street were common in Shanghai, at least in those days when tension felt so high, they rarely came to blows&#x2014;�and no intervention was undertaken by the crowd. But the two piqued bodies were electric, their muscles tensed with adrenaline and the faces above them contorted in pent-�up �anger.<br><br>This restraint was more arresting than a punch or shove would have been. A slap of flesh to cheekbone would have provided a moment of relief; a blow would have forced a climax, a gasp, some kind of release, after which the paused city could transform itself back into its loud moving swarm. Bodies would move on, shopping bags would sag to rest on kitchen counters. But this simmering, unrequited tension, it was in the bones of the place. It boiled in arguments on streets, in the alleys of the hutongs sitting stubbornly in the shadows of the developers who waited to bulldoze them, and in the posture of the old men who spat at the ground as a Ferrari passed. It was a pressure that surrounded you and lodged in your head and became your own tension. If ever a place set the stage for a confrontation of any kind, Shanghai did: a theater in which you were occasionally the spectator in the crowd, or, by turns, the person in the middle, fighting.<br><br>Things hadn&#x2019;t blown up for me yet, of course. My husband and I had just come in over the Lupu Bridge from the airport, and on the smooth white polyester backseat of a taxi we had been whisked through six lanes of light green taxis and loaded trailer trucks, over shining new bridges full of a thousand years of promise looking down at the slow-�moving, ancient brown rivers. Our car was in the old concessions of Shanghai when we came across this scene, creeping among a patchwork of crumbling European architecture bordered by bland high-�rise complexes, all skirted by the life and labor that kept twenty million people eating, moving, and surviving in a metropolis that seemed to have no end, and no discernible way out.<br><br>For me, there was no excitement like that which could be generated by a move around the world. This was the third time I had done it. Swapping a life in one place for a new life in another created an energy capable of invigorating even people like us, who were tired of living with each other. I had begged my husband to move to China for years. I was not allowed to leave him, so perhaps if I left enough places with him, it would suffice.<br><br>And I had longed for China. I had dreamed of being here so audibly and adamantly that the dream drove me into Chinese class and came out of my mouth contorted in the form of sounds like &#x201c;zh,&#x201d; &#x201c;xi,&#x201d; and &#x201c;yun&#x201d;&#x2014;�articulations that made my cheek muscles ache with the effort. My husband wasn&#x2019;t one for dreaming on his own, and he was content where he was, but I yearned for China like a death drive.<br><br>In the eyes of all the people I cared about, I ended up just that: dead.<br><br>But my goal was not death, it was life&#x2014;�other people&#x2019;s lives. I had been trying to save lives seventy hours a month for years as a missionary of sorts (what we called &#x201c;pioneering&#x201d;) in my hometown of Vancouver, Canada, knocking at doors to warn people, people who didn&#x2019;t care, doors that opened (if they opened at all) to disdain, to anger, to apathy, and in the best cases, to a sort of bemused tolerance. I had dedicated my life to save from a fiery Armageddon the inhabitants of my self-�satisfied West Coast city, a population of people who cared very little about the impending death they faced.<br><br>This unwelcomed work was made easier because I had friends who did it with me, and we went door-to-door, in all weather, drinking Starbucks coffees and noting down who was not at home on our Watchtower-�issue lined paper sheets, returning the next week to more closed doors, indulging in an occasional smugness, knowing that they would regret their apathy one day. It was work without pay but done alongside eight million people around the world who were trained week in and week out, and all believed exactly the same things I had been taught as a little girl.<br><br>As futile as this work might sound, we had given up any thought of building a life in the world we had been born into, because this world was ending. Soon, we would live in paradise, on Earth, and God would bring destruction on those who were not of our faith. It was our duty to save them, or if not save, at least warn them. We were very invested in the trade-�off we had made. We gave up any hope of a career, or education, financial security, and certain relationships, all for the sake of saving these people, and goddammit&#x2014;�no pun intended&#x2014;�we were very concerned about their impending destruction. You wanted to save just one of these uppity, self-�satisfied people for your trouble. I can use the &#x201c;we&#x201d; and speak with such certitude of a collective of over eight million people because we all believed without a shadow of a doubt that this paradise would soon be ours.<br><br>And thus, week by week, I took the card given to me by the elders in the congregation, on which was a map of the territory I was to cover, and was assigned a partner to work with. I went door-to-door, preaching throughout my community, giving my sermons, handing out my publications, and noting down house numbers and symbols on the lined record forms tucked into the map&#x2019;s plastic pouch. &#x201c;NH&#x201d; for not home. &#x201c;B-CA&#x201d; for busy, call again. &#x201c;DNC&#x201d; for do not call (if someone was especially threatening). Those householders who told me that they weren&#x2019;t interested or, worse yet, hid behind the curtain, pretending they weren&#x2019;t home, I simply scratched off till the next month, when they&#x2019;d get another chance.<br><br>In this way, I kept knocking, surprised every year that I was still here in this doomed world, and that these people in the big houses were still alive. In time, I discovered that Chinese immigrants in my city were slightly more willing to hear me out, and I began to try to learn their language so as to teach them &#x201c;the truth.&#x201d; I derived meaning from the busy activity of my life and from my friends in the close community of fellow preachers around me. The organization and these people and this service were what held my life in place and gave it its purpose, even if no one listened. I had been trained from birth to never stray from this hub of belief, this safety. My life depended on it.<br><br>Given the possibility that I might meet one interested person in these thousands of hours of preaching, I did a lot of preparation. I attended the five required meetings a week held in our congregation, where we studied the Bible and were trained in how to convert people to our interpretation of it. I read all the appointed materials and underlined the correct answers to questions cited below the paragraphs. Who the author of these materials was, I did not know, other than that the writings came from a Governing Body of men in Brooklyn who were the unquestioned leaders of us, God&#x2019;s people, men whose duty it was to give us our spiritual food at the proper time.<br><br>Our meetings followed the same structure every week, and were the same around the world. The conductor of the meeting read out the questions from a magazine written by the Governing Body. No matter what the question&#x2014;�be it: &#x201c;Why does God permit suffering?&#x201d;&#x2014;�the paragraph had the answer. Was the question: &#x201c;Why do we die?&#x201d; We had all the answers to the unsettling aspects of being human, there in our literature. The brother asking the questions was so good at reading the questions he became convinced, no doubt, that he was questioning. And studying hard, we found the answers we wanted there before us. This constant study and easy answers to any and all questions was satisfying, a luxury available only to the in�doctrinated, and I won&#x2019;t say I don&#x2019;t miss it, like any luxury to which one has become accustomed.<br><br>This kind of peace of mind bred a certain self-�confidence, a certainty of purpose. I did not fear leaving my home and �moving far away, to this Communist country, a place where my religion had been banned since the 1950s, a place where those who went against the government were frequently &#x201c;dis�appeared&#x201d; or executed. I was doing God&#x2019;s will, and even if I died for doing it, I would have life everlasting on a paradise Earth after all those self-�satisfied worldly people were killed.<br><br>And so I was in China on this day in 2005, riding in a taxi, our suitcases in the trunk packed with Bibles stuffed into socks and study books shoved into pairs of underwear. We knew very little about how our religion functioned here, if it did at all. The brothers in charge in Hong Kong who had approved us to come and serve here had simply told us that everything would be made clear, but not until we arrived. I knew nothing about how we would worship and preach in Shanghai, or what my life would look like, because anyone who knew was for�bidden to tell so as not to endanger the people doing the work. As we carved our way between the rows and rows of vehicles and I looked at the thousands of faces we passed, I wondered how many Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, foreign and local, might be in this city.<br><br>The taxi turned into a driveway and we found ourselves in a drop-�off area surrounded by eight massive buildings holding up the lives of thousands of people lived midair, buttressed on all sides by hundreds of other buildings that looked more or less like them.<br><br>Our friends Jay and Emma had come to China a couple months before us, also to preach. Before that, the four of us had lived in Taiwan for three years; we had moved there to improve our limited Mandarin. My husband and I had arrived in Taipei at the peak of the SARS epidemic, and rented a room from a sister in the congregation who had been left the apartment by her blind parents. She and her sister lived in the dark, even though they could see&#x2014;�the windows were blacked out, and the sisters rarely turned a light on.</p><h2>Bus Stops</h2><p>This simple story, following a bus on its daily route, encourages children to find a variety of objects in the illustrations.

Poor Michael Finnegan's violin playing is sorely underappreciated. It is only when he finds a dog he names Quinn-igan (who enjoys the awful "din-igan" of the "violin-igan") that the man is truly happy. In this adapted and elongated version of the traditional song, verses have been added to create some semblance of a story. Sometimes it's a bit of a stretch, as when Michael Finnegan "Took the money from their tin-igan,/Bought a house and moved right in-igan" or when he "Played so loud it was a sin-igan." Still, the book is sure to be a hit with the storytime crowd. The exuberance of this silly romp is wonderfully conveyed in the wacky watercolor-and-ink illustrations that show the tattered, unshaven man and his grinning canine companion.-Piper L.

He was much more than that, of course, but his transforming experiments in what a later acolyte would call "genetics" were less well known. When he published the results of his many attempts to discover the mechanisms by which traits are passed from one generation to the next--in Mendel's case, in sweet peas--it was in the proceedings of a local scientific study group, and it would take nearly two decades before researchers in more august institutions would in turn discover Mendel's work and apply it to their own revolutionizing biology in the process.<p> Mendel's life was full of disappointments: he failed his qualifying examinations to teach high school several times, and he had trouble getting the scientific establishment of his day to take him seriously. In her lucid, often moving life of the great (and to all purposes self-taught) scientist, Robin Marantz Henig gives readers a view of the deeply religious man himself and of his work not only in the context of his time but also in light of recent developments in the constantly changing field of genetics. Taking issue with historians of science who have sought to discount Mendel's contributions to the field, she makes a well-defended claim that the monk in his small garden should be honored as a genius: "a man with a vision and the dedication to carry it to its brilliant, radical conclusion." Her book is a fitting, and very welcome, memorial. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Robin Marantz Henig is the author of seven books. Her most recent, The Monk in the Garden: The Lost and Found Genius of Gregor Mendel, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award.</p><h2>Family and Community in Ireland: Second Edition</h2><p>this text constitutes a classic in anthropological literature and in the sociology of the family. Based on fieldwork carried out as part of the Harvard Irish Study in Ireland, 1931-1936, it is an account of life in rural county Clare and in the county town, Ennis. There were three strands to the Irish Study: a survey of the physical anthropology of Ireland by Earnest Hooton, published in 1955; an archaeological survey; and a social-anthropological and economic strand directed by Lloyd Warner of Yankee City fame. Family and Community in Ireland is an account of this third strand. The book was first published in 1940 and written largely by Conrad Maynadier Arensberg (1910-1997); he was one of the two main field researchers on the social-anthropological aspect of the overall study dealing mainly with life on the small family farms of a number of town lands in County Clare. As a prelude to the main book, Arensberg had published The Irish Countryman (1937) after completing his Ph.D. dissertation. The 1968 volume is a detailed account of many aspects of rural and small town Irish life of 20 years earlier. It deals with the life and work of these communities in terms of the economy, family labour, occupations, markets, inheritance patterns, mobility, and emigration. Even more central, however, are the themes of family and kinship. There is also considerable quantitative economic and demographic data in figures and tables. Familism is central to the work in that the family is seen to constitute the main organizing and structuring principle in the community. Its centrality as not only a social but also an economic system is evident to the authors: this is clear in their accounts of many of the issues they examine. The very choice of marriage partner is strongly economic; as manifest in the account of the practice of matchmaking, this is a highly instrumental process.</p><p></p><h2>The Medici : Godfathers of the Renaissance</h2><p>A dazzling history of the modest family which rose to become one of the most powerful in Europe, The Medici is a remarkably modern story of power, money and ambition. Against the background of an age which saw the rebirth of ancient and classical learning - of humanism which penetrated and explored the arts and sciences and the &#39;dark&#39; knowledge of alchemy, astrology, and numerology - Paul Strathern explores the intensely dramatic rise and fall of the Medici family in Florence, as well as the Italian Renaissance which they did so much to sponsor and encourage. Interwoven into the narrative are the lives of many of the great Renaissance artists with whom the Medici had dealings, including Leonardo, Michelangelo and Donatello, as well as scientists like Galileo and Pico della Mirandola, both of whom clashed with the religious authorities. In this enthralling study, Paul Strathern also follows the fortunes of those members of the Medici family who achieved success away from Florence, including the two Medici popes and Catherine de&#39; Medicis who became Queen of France and played a major role in that country through three turbulent reigns. Vivid and accessible, the book ends with the gloriously decadent decline of the Medici family in Florence as they strove to be recognised as European Princes.</p><p>A dazzling history of the family that rose to become one of the most powerful in Europe and who sponsored many of the most important developments of the Italian Renaissance.

He and his wife, Wendy, have three children.</b></b>Based largely on Pope John Paul's "theology of the body," West's message is that sexual bonding is an aspect of Christ's connection to His Church on earth. Read with youthful enthusiasm by Paul Smith, the program discusses the Christian practice of cloaking sexual impulses in spiritual imagery and promoting strategies for managing such impulses. In West's confusing view of the Church's teachings about homosexuality, being gay is not a sin, but it is evil, a deviation from God's plan, and a sign of man's fallen nature! Still, the writing sounds less punitive than some religious approaches to sex and might help people who are desperate for some outside authority to manage this part of their lives.

At a party, the narrator, a screenwriter, rescues a young woman who staggers with drunken determination into the Pacific. He is living far from his wife in New York and long ago shed any illusions about the value of his work. He just wants to be left alone. And yet without really meaning to, he gets involved with the young woman, who has, it seems, no illusions about love, especially with married men. She&#x2019;s a survivor, even if her beauty is a little battered from years of not quite making it in the pictures. She&#x2019;s just like him, he thinks, and as their casual relationship takes on an increasingly troubled and destructive intensity, it seems that might just be true, only not in the way he supposes.</p><p><b>Alfred Hayes</b> (1911&#x2013;1985) was born into a Jewish family in Whitechapel, London, though his father, a barber, trained violinist, and sometime bookie, moved the family to New York when Hayes was three. After attending City College, Hayes worked as a reporter for the <i>New York American</i> and <i>Daily Mirror</i> and began to publish poetry, including &#x201c;Joe Hill,&#x201d; about the legendary labor organizer, which was later set to music by the composer Earl Robinson and recorded by Joan Baez. During World War II Hayes was assigned to a special services unit in Italy; after the war he stayed on in Rome, where he contributed to the story development and scripts of several classic Italian neorealist films, including Roberto Rossellini&#x2019;s <i>Pais�</i> (1946) and Vittorio De Sica&#x2019;s <i>Bicycle Thieves </i>(1948), and gathered material for two popular novels, <i>All Thy Conquests</i> (1946) and <i>The Girl on the Via Flaminia</i> (1949), the latter the basis for the 1953 film <i>Act of Love</i>, starring Kirk Douglas. In the late 1940s Hayes went to work in Hollywood, writing screenplays for <i>Clash by Night</i>, <i>A Hatful of Rain</i>, <i>The Left Hand of God</i>, <i>Joy in the Morning</i>, and Fritz Lang&#x2019;s <i>Human Desire</i>, as well as scripts for television.

Brilliant sunlight slants across jostling terra-cotta roofs, and great plane trees cast velvety shade across ancient squares where the only sound is that of a moss-covered fountain. <em>The Most Beautiful Villages of Provence</em> stunningly evokes the beauty and spirit of Provence, which has drawn visitors to it from ancient times to the present day. Its enduring charm is here celebrated in Palmer's magnificent photographs of such gems as Riez and its fields of lavender or the mysterious cobbled paths of Crestet. These entrancing places, and many others, make this book a lasting tribute to a magical world.

Getting in touch with the unconscious can be difficult and dangerous. Our ordinary approach to life, our trained and cultivated ways of thinking, are allergic to this swampy unknown. We lose our bearings, we panic. The Tarot cards are like &#39;an idiots guide&#39; to the unconscious, an easy way to subvert the rational and allow the energies beneath to creep up through the floorboards. If you learn to shuffle and to deal the twenty-two major cards of this ancient museum of the unconscious, it will help you to familiarise yourself with a symbolic way of thinking and domesticate an underworld of otherwise meaningless shadows and shapes. This book gives an introduction to the Tarot, a history of its uses and abuses, a practical guide to its value as an underground map. It also provides a meditation on each one of the twenty-two major arcana which can help the reader to undertake their own spiritual journey. Mark Patrick Hederman is a philosopher and monk.</p><p>Mark Patrick Hederman is a philosopher and monk. A founding editor of the cultural journal The Crane Bag, he is also the author of The Haunted Inkwell: Art and Our Future (The Columba Press) and the bestseller, Kissing the Dark (Veritas).When an Irish monk takes on the tarot, you know you're going to get an interesting perspective, and Hederman's impressively researched book lives up to such promise. Although the heart of the book is a series of philosophic musings on each of the cards of the renowned major arcana (the Fool, the Hermit, the Devil, the Tower), the preceding chapters set the stage for even wary readers to embrace the symbolic possibilities inherent in the cards' mysterious illustrations. Although decried as satanic by some Christians, the tarot doesn't express an occult or evil force, Hederman argues, but simply records the deeply dreaming mind. From the posited collective unconscious, the images bubble forth, none of them "owned" by any religious or philosophic group but rather accessible and meaningful to all. Hederman comments on the deck's occasionally uncanny capability for prediction by exploring counterarguments to the mechanical universe: the tarot may permit connection with the noncausal reality of space-time rather than "seeing" the future. An excellent choice for New Age patrons. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He envisioned a nuclear exchange with China; a modern black plague; an asteroid tearing apart the crust of the earth, unleashing a new dark age. Such singularities didn&#x2019;t frighten him, he claimed; they offered freedom. They opened wormholes to a sublime realm of fantasy and chaos. Worst-case scenarios, he said, were for him games of logic. How vast a nightmare could he imagine, and to what level of precision? What was possible? What should we be afraid of? <br>We knew that Mitchell&#x2019;s &#x201c;logic games&#x201d; line was a bluff. Worst-case scenarios filled him with very real terror. Late in the evening he raced out of his bedroom in a panic, cheeks flushed, eyes haunted. He flipped on his desk lamp, pounded numbers into his calculator, and scrawled equations and odds ratios. It was a near-nightly ritual. The next morning we&#x2019;d find him there asleep, facedown on his papers, his cheek ink stained with numbers like a prison tattoo. <br>None of us, to be clear, lost any sleep over Mitchell&#x2019;s prophecies. We thought he was a little mad, and a little depressed, even by U. of C. standards. He may have understood numbers, but everyday life was too complex for him. We felt for him, we did&#x2014;he&#x2019;d had it tough from the start. His name was its own kind of worst-case scenario, a throwback to an era of midwestern Anglo-Saxon gentility. <i>Mitchell</i>. Who named their child Mitchell? Parents with high aspirations and antiquated ideals. From his mother, a stout, fair Missourian, he inherited a twangy Ozark accent, flat russet hair that lay on his head like straw at the bottom of a pigpen, and a loathing for Overland Park, his native suburb. His father, a Hungarian refugee who owned housing projects in east Kansas City, contributed an eccentric, brooding manner and a depressive sense of humor. At first we wondered how Mitchell had been admitted, but it soon became apparent that he was a mathematical zealot. During orientation he wore a series of gray T-shirts bearing the faces of &#x201c;Legendary Statisticians&#x201d; (this written in a pompous cursive): C. R. Rao, Leonardo Fibonacci, Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov. We hadn&#x2019;t heard of any of them. We suspected that Mitchell had silk-screened the shirts himself. If he wasn&#x2019;t a mathematical genius, something else was wrong with him. <br>Put out of your mind, if you can, all the posters and magazine photographs and T-shirts bearing Mitchell Zukor&#x2019;s own face. Try to imagine the great man as a college student. You would not have recognized him then. Clean-shaven, round faced, eyes dark and hooded. He was flagrantly rust belt. He looked like a swing voter. The old-fashioned crew cut, the neck reddish with razor bumps, and his retiring, timid manner gave the impression of a perversely premature descent into middle age. Had he not been assigned to our dorm, we likely wouldn&#x2019;t have considered him more than a curiosity, like the chairman of the college Republicans who slept in his bow tie, or the sad, skinny girl who walked around campus cradling a ragged teddy bear. <br>As might be expected, he was always with the computer: in the lab during the day and at his desk in the common room at night. When friends visited, he&#x2019;d participate amiably enough in the conversation for a few minutes, though before long he&#x2019;d retreat to his screen, scanning the Web for articles about artificial intelligence or manned space exploration or the lives of great mathematicians. I&#x2019;d glance at him uneasily from time to time. Why wasn&#x2019;t he trying like the rest of us? His hunched back, expanding the fabric of a Peter L. Bernstein T-shirt, projected absolute indifference. Even when he was eating midnight takeout, or watching cable news, he seemed lost in the higher questions. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I came to know Mitchell casually over the years, but I can&#x2019;t say we had any particularly meaningful interaction until shortly before graduation. I&#x2019;m referring to the Puget Sound earthquake. <br>It&#x2019;s been written that Mitchell saw it coming, Seattle&#x2014;that he tried to tell the world, but no one would listen to him. This, I feel confident insisting, is pure mythology. Mitchell was prepared for disaster, sure, but he had no better idea than anyone else what was going to unfold that Tuesday. I know because I was with him. <br>It was a chilly autumn morning in Chicago. We were in Cobb Hall for Introduction to Russian Literature, a.k.a. Sputnik for Nudniks. A fraction of the students were first-years genuinely excited to read Tolstoy, but most were fourth-years like Mitchell and me, who needed the credit to graduate. On that terrible morning, shortly after we sat down, a murmur spread through the four-hundred-seat auditorium, growing in intensity and volume. There followed a burst of laughter and then another. My first thought was that the professor, Dziga Olesha, had canceled class, but the laughter was too harsh, too peculiar, and not at all mirthful. It was surprised, uncomfortable, even slightly deranged, the stifled sound a husband might make upon interrupting his wife and her lover: laughter as defense mechanism. In row after row, like the reverse of a wave at a baseball game, the students bent over their laps and activated their portables. I was reaching for my own when Professor Olesha entered. <br>He was a muscular man, low to the ground, with a bushy Leninite mustache and a supercilious varnish over his eyes. His blue oxford flapped open at the collar, exposing a repugnant coil of black hair. He pressed a button, and the large screen over the stage illuminated with an image of a municipal garden. <br>&#x201c;The family estate of Alexander Pushkin,&#x201d; muttered Olesha. <br>A girl in the second row shook her hand in the air. &#x201c;Professor?&#x201d; <br>Olesha, ignoring her, clicked his remote. <br>&#x201c; <i>The Bronze Horseman</i>,&#x201d; said Olesha. The statue appeared on the screen&#x2014;the powerful horse bucking from its mountainous plinth. <br>Several other hands went up. Portables buzzed. A shimmer of hysteria passed through the room. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; Mitchell whispered to me. <br>&#x201c;Professor <i>Olesha</i>,&#x201d; said another student. Someone coughed. Someone choked. <br>It was no use. Olesha, in his clotted voice, read from the poem: <br> <i>&#x201c;Rushing through the empty square</i> <br> <i>He hears behind him as it were</i> <br> <i>Thunders that rattle in a chorus</i> <br> <i>A gallop ponderous, sonorous</i> <br> <i>That shakes the pavement.&#x201d;</i> <br>&#x201c;Olesha!&#x201d; <br>The professor looked sharply down from the stage, a lock of hair falling over one eye. <br>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; The disgust was plain on his face. <br>&#x201c;Professor? There has been a huge earthquake. In Seattle.&#x201d; <br>Olesha squinted. &#x201c;Explain yourself.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Seattle. The city is destroyed.&#x201d; <br>Olesha swept the hair out of his eye. &#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Feedback squealed over the speakers. &#x201c;I am sorry to hear this.&#x201d; <br>He called up the next slide: a portrait of the young poet, his cheeks furred with muttonchops. <br>&#x201c;On June sixth, 1799, Alexander Sergeyevich was born.&#x201d; <br>Two dozen students rose loudly to their feet, gathering their laptops and bags, pushing their way out of the lecture hall. There was a tussle in the row ahead of us. A female student, her face heavily flushed, had become entangled with the boy sitting beside her. In her frustration she shoved him. <br> <i>&#x201c;My brother lives in Seattle!&#x201d;</i> she shrieked. She ran up the aisle sobbing. <br>Olesha could no longer ignore the tumult. Red with rage, he pounded the lectern twice. &#x201c;For anyone who is serious about this course, I will conduct the rest of the lecture across the hall.&#x201d; He marched out. Nobody followed. <br>Five seconds later the portrait of Pushkin flickered off the giant screen. Someone was manipulating the remote control. The lights dimmed, and a live television feed came on. The reporter&#x2019;s voice was loud and hoarse in the speakers. We saw incoherent flashes of flame, glass, metal, sea. No one spoke. We were trying to understand what we were watching. Beside me Mitchell was shaking. He shielded his eyes like a child at a horror movie. <br>I hardly need to rehearse for you the emotion of that day, the confusion and terror, but certain images I will never forget. A naked child, covered in ash, walking dazed through a mountain of rubble. A helicopter, its blades spinning frantically, sinking slowly into the sound. A convertible impaled on a stoplight. A dozen bodies running madly in every direction, silhouetted against a swelling wall of flame. The news reporter, no doubt in shock himself, stopped talking. <br>The images cohered into a narrative and we began to make sense of it. The silence in the lecture hall was broken by three screams in rapid succession. These were followed by the muted whimper of hundreds of people weeping. Cell phones buzzed. But most of us stayed in our seats, transfixed by what we were seeing. Everything happened very slowly. The network, having lost several of its street feeds, held for several minutes on an overhead shot of the Seattle harbor taken from the vantage of a looming blimp. Great billows of smoke obscured downtown, so the extent of damage was unclear. For all we knew, there might have been, beneath the blooming clouds of ash, an abyss as deep as the center of the earth. &#x201c;We want to hold our breath,&#x201d; said the news anchor, stuttering. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not jump to any conclusions.&#x201d; A correspondent called from a parking lot in North Seattle. &#x201c;There is a complete cessation of regular life,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Everyone is standing outside, staring at the ground. Waiting. Staring at the ground.&#x201d; The anchor thanked her. &#x201c;We want,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;to hold our breath.&#x201d; <br>It seems horrible now, but I remember laughing. It started in my stomach, a light, ticklish sensation like a bubble rising, rising in my chest until it burst out in a wild guffaw. Nobody noticed&#x2014;there were a lot of odd, uncontrolled noises in that lecture hall. The thought that made me laugh, though it is not at all funny in retrospect, was this: I felt that I had entered Mitchell Zukor&#x2019;s head. Sitting in that hall as the smoke plumed on the screen, I felt as if I were eavesdropping on one of Mitchell&#x2019;s nightmares. I felt very close to him then. <br>But when I glanced at Mitchell I saw that he had turned away. Something else had claimed his attention. I followed his gaze to the other end of our row, where an auburn-haired girl had collapsed awkwardly in her seat. Her head was twisted to one side, and her arms dangled crookedly beneath her. She was alone. In the commotion no one else seemed to have noticed her. <br>Mitchell shot past me, racing down the row, knocking his kneecaps against the chairs as he went. I followed, glancing back and forth between the images of the atrocity and the fainted girl. The juxtaposition was unsettling. It was as if somehow the monster on the screen had reached its talons into Cobb Hall and snatched one of us. <br>When I caught up to Mitchell, he was frozen, hunched over the girl. <br>&#x201c;She needs fresh air,&#x201d; I said. <br>At the sound of my voice he spun around. His eyes were large and white. <br>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t faint,&#x201d; said Mitchell. <br>&#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d; <br>He pulled himself to one side so I could see the girl&#x2019;s face. I didn&#x2019;t recognize her. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s <i>Elsa</i>,&#x201d; said Mitchell. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Elsa Bruner!&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Mitchell had first seen Elsa Bruner on a visit the previous October to the Student Health Service. Mitchell was on good terms with the people at SHS&#x2014;a regular customer. They knew all his specials before he sat down. What would it be this week? A red, scaly patch of unknown provenance? Neck lump? Vague pain about the groin? The nurses welcomed him with patient smiles and made him wait until they had treated everyone with unimagined health concerns. <br>That particular October morning the doctor had called Elsa Bruner&#x2019;s name and a pallid, slender, but seemingly healthful girl stood up. She met with the doctor for ten minutes and, after signing a form at the front desk, went on her way. She was not especially attractive or even distinct&#x2014;a small nose, reddish brown hair hanging loosely to her shoulders, soft eyes spaced slightly too far apart, a delicate chin&#x2014;and Mitchell would have immediately forgotten her had he not seen her medical form when he checked out. (Mitchell, the doctor had cheerily informed him, was merely exhausted and overstressed; he did not have Crohn&#x2019;s disease.) Elsa&#x2019;s medical file, thickly stuffed, was still lying on the counter, and Mitchell couldn&#x2019;t help but notice, printed in large caps on the top of the front page, the word &#x201c;BRUGADA.&#x201d; Other than several cardiologists in the medical school, Mitchell was undoubtedly the only person on campus who understood the meaning of this word. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a heart disorder,&#x201d; he explained in the dining hall that night. &#x201c;It can strike you dead at any time. But otherwise you&#x2019;re completely healthy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a thing you made up.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A girl at U. of C. has it. A second-year. Her name is Elsa Bruner. She was at SHS this morning.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Her heart stopped?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. She was probably there for a routine EKG.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Is she hot.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you get it? She can drop dead at any time.&#x201d; <br>We gave prudent nods. &#x201c;So she&#x2019;s desperate.&#x201d; <br>Mitchell ignored us. &#x201c;Can you imagine?&#x201d; he said. One of his hands began absently to pull at his hair. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s a walking worst-case scenario. How does she get out of bed?&#x201d; <br>We murmured halfhearted words of concern, but it was too late. We&#x2019;d lost him. He stood up, shaking his head, and walked out of the dining hall, into the cold night. <br>Mitchell must have thought about Elsa Bruner often, but I don&#x2019;t recall that he mentioned her again, and I know he never talked to her until the day of the earthquake. I also know that he never returned to the Student Health Service. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The lecture hall was nearly empty when the two paramedics arrived. Elsa was sitting up in her chair, her hand on her heart. Mitchell&#x2019;s hand was on his heart too. He was having pains. <br>&#x201c;How do you feel?&#x201d; <br>She didn&#x2019;t appear to hear him. There was a quavering, absent curl to her lips. &#x201c;It happened again.&#x201d; <br>She closed her eyes. <br>&#x201c;Elsa?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m only resting,&#x201d; she said, blinking. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s over now.&#x201d; <br>She tried to wave the paramedics away, but they ignored her and slapped a blood pressure cuff around her arm. They scanned her student ID into a black machine that resembled a credit card reader. A buzzer sounded and a red light flashed. This seemed to alarm them. <br>&#x201c;Ms. Bruner? We need to take you to the hospital. Are you able to walk?&#x201d; <br>She nodded and rose stiffly from her seat. <br>&#x201c;Do I know you?&#x201d; she asked Mitchell. <br>He shook his head and introduced himself. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry you&#x2019;re&nbsp;&#x2026; sick.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d; She pointed to her heart. &#x201c;I did. I did it all by myself.&#x201d; <br>The two paramedics, each holding one of her tiny elbows, escorted her from the hall. <br>On the screen a section of the Alaskan Way Viaduct, clogged with morning commuter traffic, collapsed. The giant concrete slab dropped twenty feet, shattering on the pavement below like a pane of glass. The cars bounced like dice. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>When we graduated in June, the panic raised by the Puget Sound earthquake had become part of us. It was slapped across our faces like a birthmark. We were dubbed Generation Seattle. Both the best and the worst suddenly seemed possible. Elsa Bruner, I learned, had dropped out and started a cooperative farm in Maine. Mitchell, like so much...</p><h2>The Lord of the Rings the Return of the King</h2><p>The third volume of The Lord of the Rings, now featuring Tolkien&#39;s original unused dust-jacket design.

The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs."</i><p> Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i>. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. ("Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job. </p><p> Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>When Walker Percy penned these prophetic words in his foreword to the first edition of A Confederacy of Dunces, he could not have known just how wide Toole's "world of readers" would become. Released by Louisiana State University Press in April 1980, A Confederacy of Dunces is nothing short of a publishing phenomenon. Turned down by countless publishers and submitted by the author's mother years after his suicide, the book won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Today, there are over 1,500,000 copies in print worldwide in eighteen languages.<p>Toole's lunatic and sage novel introduces one of the most memorable characters in American literature, Ignatius Reilly, whom Percy dubs "slob extraordinary, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one -- who is in violent revolt against the entire modern age". Ignatius' ire explodes when his mother backs her car into another automobile. The owner of the damaged vehicle insists on payment; Mrs. Reilly demands that her son cease watching television and writing in his Big Chief tablet and get a job.</p><p>Set in New Orleans, A Confederacy of Dunces outswifts Swift, one of whose essays gives the book its title. As its characters burst into life, they leave the region and literature forever changed by their presences -- Ignatius and his mother; Miss Trixie, the octogenarian assistant accountant at Levy Pants; inept, wan Patrolman Mancuso; Darlene, the Bourbon Street stripper with a penchant for poultry; Jones, the jivecat in space-age dark glasses. Satire and farce animate A Confederacy of Dunces; tragic awareness ennobles it.</p><p>Louisiana State University Press celebrates A Confederacy of Dunces' twentieth year withthis anniversary edition, which includes a new introduction by Andrei Codrescu that examines the relationship of this modern-day classic to the city whose pulse it so brilliantly captures.</p></p><h2>Wolf-Speaker</h2><p>Daine joins forces with her animal friends and Tortallan sorcerer Numair to battle evil sorcerers, ogres, an army, and a greedy emperor mining for rare black opals, and to stop the destruction of a beautiful valley.

Drawing as much on Baba Ram Dass and Vaclav Havel as he does on Peter Drucker and WalMart for his case studies, Hawken is on a one-man crusade to reform our economic system by demanding that First World businesses reduce their consumption of energy and resources by 80 percent in the next 50 years. As if that weren't enough, Hawken argues that business goals should be redefined to embrace such fuzzy categories as whether the work is aesthetically pleasing and the employees are having fun; this applies to corporate giants and mom-and-pop operations alike. He proposes a culture of business in which the real world, the natural world, is allowed to flourish as well, and in which the planet's needs are addressed. Wall Street may not be ready for Hawken's provocative brand of environmental awareness, but this fine book is full of captivating ideas.<p>The world has changed in the seventeen years since the controversial initial publication of Paul Hawken's <em>Ecology of Commerce</em>, a stirring treatise about the perceived antagonism between ecology and business. Yet Hawken's impassioned argument&#x2014;that business both causes the most egregious abuses of the environment and, crucially, holds the most potential for solving our sustainability problems&#x2014;is more relevant and resonant than ever.</p><p>Containing updated and revised material for a new audience, <em>The Ecology of Commerce</em> presents a compelling vision of the restorative (rather than destructive) economy we must create, centered on eight imperatives:</p><ul> <li> Reduce energy carbon emissions 80 percent by 2030 and total natural resource usage 80 percent by 2050.</li> <li> Provide secure, stable, and meaningful employment to people everywhere.</li> <li> Be self-organizing rather than regulated or morally mandated.</li> <li> Honor market principles.</li> <li> Restore habitats, ecosystems, and societies to their optimum.</li> <li> Rely on current income.</li> <li> Be fun and engaging, and strive for an aesthetic outcome.</li></ul></p><h2>Dragon and Liberator: The Sixth Dragonback Adventure</h2><p>In this exciting space adventure, fourteen-year-old Jack Morgan and Draycos, a poet/warrior K'da dragon who can hide himself as a tattoo on Jack's back, have their backs to the wall. Brought together by a twist of fate, these two have been through a lot of scrapes, risking death and imprisonment on worlds far and wide, seeking justice for Jack and information that might save Draycos's people from a genocidal ambush. But now, Neverlin, the man who killed Jack's parents and destroyed the scout fleet of which Draycos was the sole survivor, is about to ambush millions of K'da refugees, and kill them with a Death weapon that kills any living being within its range. To prevent Neverlin from eradicating the K'da race, Jack and Draycos must somehow disable the Death. <br><br>But for Jack and Draycos, things never seem to go the way they should. When Jack's friend Alison is captured, Jack gives himself up to keep her from being harmed. Neverlin, with Jack and Draycos as his prisoners, holds all the cards. But desperate times call for desperate measures, as time is running out, not just for our young heroes, but also for the millions of K'da who face annihilation, and resourceful Jack and his remarkable ally will fine a way . . . or die trying. <br>&nbsp;<br>A powerful, thrilling conclusion to this terrific Young Adult six-book series.

He lives in Oregon.</p>Chapter One<br>One month.<br>The words echoed through Draycos&#x2019;s mind as he lay in his two-dimensional form against Jack Morgan&#x2019;s back, arms, and&nbsp; legs. One month.<br>One month left until the refugee fleet carrying the remainder of his K&#x2019;da people and their Shontine symbionts arrived here in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy. One month until their long,wearying journey would be over.<br>One month until they flew into the ambush that Arthur Neverlin and the Valahgua were preparing for them.<br>Or perhaps even less than that. After two years in hyperspace, they could easily be a week or two early for their rendezvous. <br>Draycos raised his head a little from Jack&#x2019;s shoulder, his eyebrow ridges and spiny crest pressing up against the boy&#x2019;s shirt. Through the windshield of the car Jack had borrowed from a used-vehicle lot, he could see the Brummgan town of Ponocce City laid out in front of them. Its ugly color scheme, thankfully, was shrouded by the darkness of night and the city&#x2019;s mediocre streetlight system. Three miles straight ahead, its lights reflected against the low clouds, was the spaceport where some of the enemy forces were even now being gathered together. <br>Draycos swiveled his head around, lifting his eyes over the back of Jack&#x2019;s shirt. Directly behind the car, rising over the low houses around it like a breaking ocean wave, was the tall ceramic wall that surrounded the Chookoock family estate.<br>There were some very unpleasant memories tied up with that wall and the evil people who hid behind it. Draycos could imagine how Jack must be feeling right now as the memories of his brief time as a Chookoock slave were forced back upon him.<br>Draycos? Jack&#x2019;s thought flowed into the K&#x2019;da&#x2019;s mind along the strange telepathic link the two of them had somehow developed. You okay?<br>Yes, Draycos replied. Why do you ask?<br>You&#x2019;re twitching your tail against the back of my knee, Jack told him. I thought maybe you were nervous.<br>Draycos hadn&#x2019;t even realized he&#x2019;d been doing that. My apologies, he said, bringing his tail to a halt.<br>No problem, Jack assured him. It tickled, that&#x2019;s all.<br>In the distance behind them, Draycos caught a flicker of reflected streetlight from the gate set into the white wall. &#x201c;The gate&#x2019;s opening again,&#x201d; he said aloud.<br>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; Jack said, picking up the portable sensor he&#x2019;d brought from the Essenay and pressing it against the side window. &#x201c;Geez, how many soldiers have they got in there, anyway?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;ve had around three hundred come through here, if that helps any,&#x201d; Alison Kayna&#x2019;s voice came from the comm clip attached to Jack&#x2019;s left shirt collar.<br>&#x201c;Yes, thank you, I can do basic math,&#x201d; Jack growled. &#x201c;You want to keep it down?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Relax&#x2014;they can&#x2019;t possibly hear me,&#x201d; Alison said. Her tone managed somehow to be reassuring and sarcastic at the same time. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re all the way up at the top of the hangar on one of the loading-crane supports.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Jack said tartly. &#x201c;Keep it down anyway.&#x201d;<br>They&#x2019;ll be all right, Draycos assured him. <br>I know, Jack said.<br>But the boy&#x2019;s words couldn&#x2019;t hide his tension. Especially since it was the same tension Draycos himself was feeling.<br>Because it should be him and Jack skulking around the Chookoock family&#x2019;s main shuttle hangar. It should be him and Jack watching the Brummgan mercenaries gathering for transport to the ambush point. It shouldn&#x2019;t be Alison and Taneem.<br>Especially not Taneem. The young female K&#x2019;da was intelligent and likable, and she&#x2019;d certainly shown herself willing to put herself at risk for Draycos and his people.<br>But she&#x2019;d spent most of her life as little more than an animal. Her transformation to full, sentient being was less than two months old. She still needed more learning and experience before she would be ready for even a normal K&#x2019;da life.<br>And the circumstances she and Alison were in right now were anything but normal.<br>Restlessly, Draycos lashed his tail. He should have put all four feet down right from the start and insisted that he and Jack take this part of the plan.<br>The problem was that Alison was just as stubborn as Draycos was. And, unfortunately, she&#x2019;d also had logic on her side. She and Taneem had already successfully opened one of the K&#x2019;da/Shontine safes, and that experience was worth more than any coaching that Alison could give Jack. Even Jack had admitted that. And to be fair, she had proved she was capable of handling herself.<br>But all the logic in the universe didn&#x2019;t help. Draycos&#x2019;s emotional core was still tied up in knots of frustration and concern.<br>&#x201c;Here they come,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;Looks like just three vans in this convoy. Uncle Virge?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ready, Jack lad,&#x201d; the voice of the Essenay&#x2019;s computerized personality came from the comm clip.<br>The first van reached their position. Jack held the sensor steady against the window as it rolled past, followed closely by its two companions. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he reported as the vehicles&#x2019; taillights continued down the dimly lit street. &#x201c;Uncle Virge?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;First one seems to be all personnel,&#x201d; Uncle Virge said slowly as the computer sifted through the data Jack&#x2019;s sensor had sent it. &#x201c;Looks like our standard fifteen armed Brummgas.&#x201d;<br>Draycos grimaced. Alison&#x2019;s theory was that the Patri Chookoock&#x2019;s role in this conspiracy was to supply Brummgan soldiers to crew the ships that would be attacking the K&#x2019;da and Shontine refugees. Apparently, she&#x2019;d been correct.<br>The Patri Chookoock was donating the soldiers and crews. Arthur Neverlin, once chairman of the board of the megacorporation Braxton Universis, was supplying the planning. Later,when the K&#x2019;da and Shontine were all dead, he would probably also provide the marketing system they would use to sell the technology from the looted refugee ships. The Valahgua, deadly enemies from the K&#x2019;da and Shontine&#x2019;s own far distant part of the galaxy, were providing their horrible and unstoppable Death weapon.<br>That left only the attack ships themselves. Presumably, Colonel Maximus Frost of the Malison Ring mercenaries would be supplying those.<br>And all that the unsuspecting refugees had standing between them and genocide were Jack, Draycos,Alison, and Taneem. Two young humans, and two K&#x2019;da.<br>And a single month of time.<br>&#x201c;Bingo,&#x201d; Uncle Virge&#x2019;s voice cut into Draycos&#x2019;s thoughts. &#x201c;Second van has five armed Brummgas, plus one very big chunk of metal.&#x201d;<br>Draycos felt Jack&#x2019;s muscles tighten beneath him. &#x201c;How big?&#x201d; the boy asked.<br>&#x201c;A little shorter than you and quite a bit wider,&#x201d; Uncle Virge said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m getting an unknown on the particular alloy.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; Alison said positively. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the safe.&#x201d;<br>Draycos lifted his head again to look at the vans&#x2019; retreating taillights. Each of his advance team&#x2019;s four ships had had one of those safes aboard, a safe that had contained the location of their planned rendezvous with the incoming refugee fleet.<br>But Neverlin&#x2019;s ambush of the team had killed all the K&#x2019;da and Shontine except Draycos, leaving all four safes in his hands. Two had been wrecked when Neverlin&#x2019;s men attempted to open hem. Alison, under threat to her life, had opened the third for them.<br>Three safes down. One still left.<br>And the final safe had at last been brought out from behind the protection of the white wall and was heading toward the hangar where Alison and Taneem were waiting.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t sound too eager,&#x201d; Uncle Virge warned. &#x201c;The third van has another fifteen Brummgas.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not a problem,&#x201d; Alison said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got enough sopor mist canisters planted to blanket the whole hangar. I just need to make sure all three vans are inside before I trigger them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just make sure they don&#x2019;t have gas masks on before you do it,&#x201d; Jack warned.<br>&#x201c;You want to walk me through it, just to make sure I do it right?&#x201d; Alison asked tartly. &#x201c;Relax, will you? I know what I&#x2019;m doing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hope so,&#x201d; Jack muttered as he set the sensor on the seat beside him and started the car.<br>They&#x2019;ll be all right, Draycos reassured him as the boy pulled out into the Ponocce City traffic.We&#x2019;ll be only a few minutes behind this last group. If there&#x2019;s trouble, we&#x2019;ll be in position to help.<br>Sure, Jack said. Help me watch for cops, will you? I&#x2019;m going to see if I can get a little more speed out of this crate.&nbsp;There was a distant, muted thunk. Across the hangar from where Taneem and Alison crouched on the wide crane supports, the large doors on the north wall began to roll up. &#x201c;This should be them,&#x201d; Alison murmured.<br>Taneem didn&#x2019;t answer. Her heart was beating rapidly, a cold sense of dread twisting like morning chill through her. Very soon now, the waiting would be over.<br>And she was terrified.<br>She&#x2019;d been in dangerous situations before, certainly. Several of them, in fact. But never had she found herself facing the sheer numbers of Brummgas wandering restlessly around the hangar floor below them. There were twenty-three of the aliens&#x2014;Taneem had counted them five times&#x2014;all of them carrying guns and wearing thick body armor. If Uncle Virge was right, the vans outside those opening doors carried another thirty-five of the aliens.<br>&#x201c;You all right?&#x201d; Alison&#x2019;s soft voice asked into her thoughts.<br>With an effort, Taneem lifted her silver eyes from all those guns and focused on Alison&#x2019;s calm face. An odd thought ran through Taneem&#x2019;s mind: a girl of Alison&#x2019;s mere fourteen years had no business being so calm in the middle of this much danger. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; she said, trying to keep her voice from shaking.<br>&#x201c;The waiting&#x2019;s always the hardest part,&#x201d; Alison told her. &#x201c;But try to relax. If this goes down like it&#x2019;s supposed to, neither of us will have to do any fighting.&#x201d;<br>And if it doesn&#x2019;t go down like it&#x2019;s supposed to? Taneem wondered. But there was no point in bringing that up.<br>The doors below finished opening, and three vans pulled inside. They rolled past the milling Brummgas and pulled up behind the two shuttles waiting by the much larger doors at the south end of the hangar. There had been ten such shuttles when Taneem and Alison had first arrived, which had left the hangar in pairs as each group of new passengers arrived and was loaded aboard. <br>At first Taneem had hoped the shuttles might provide the answer to their problem. Alison had brought along the transmitting device that Colonel Frost had used to track the Essenay to Rho Scorvi, and Taneem had hoped she and Alison could plant it aboard one of the shuttles and find the refugee rendezvous point that way.<br>But Alison had explained that the shuttles would simply be taking the Brummgas to another ship or group of ships waiting out in deep space. Those ships would then continue on, while the shuttles returned to Brum-a-dum.<br>Across the hangar, the doors closed again with another thunk. On the floor below, the van doors opened and the Brummgan soldiers began filing out. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Alison said, getting a grip on her remote trigger. &#x201c;Here we go.&#x201d; Flipping up the protective cover, she pressed the button.<br>Nothing happened.<br>&#x201c;Alison?&#x201d; Taneem asked anxiously, looking down at the Brummgas still filing out of their vans.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Alison assured her. &#x201c;This is a Type Four sopor. Takes longer to start working, but also keeps them asleep longer after the mist dissipates.&#x201d;<br>Taneem flicked her tail. Certainly Alison ought to know how her own weapons worked.<br>And then, all across the hangar, the Brummgas went limp and collapsed onto the floor.<br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; Alison said as she pulled on her full-helmet gas mask and tossed a coil of rope over the edge of the track. &#x201c;Here we go. Stay here until I call you.&#x201d; Getting a grip on the rope, she rolled off the support and started sliding down.<br>Taneem watched her go, scratching her claws nervously against the metal of the track support. If the Brummgas down there were faking . . .<br>But no one moved or opened fire, and a few seconds later Alison was safely down. Drawing her small Corvine pistol from its holster, the girl dropped the backpack off her shoulder and pulled it open. &#x201c;Clear,&#x201d; her muffled voice came from the comm. clip fastened to Taneem&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get the MixStar started.&#x201d;<br>Alison headed toward the middle van. Taneem watched her go, thinking about her MixStar safecracking computer. She&#x2019;d seen the device in action, and it still amazed her that such a powerful device could be concealed inside a belt and a pair of shoes. Alison reached the van, peered into the open door, and disappeared inside.<br>&#x201c;Taneem?&#x201d; Draycos&#x2019;s voice came softly. &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; Taneem assured him. &#x201c;The sopor mist seems to have worked properly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Keep an eye on the Brummgas anyway,&#x201d; Draycos said. &#x201c;Watch for twitching or movements like someone might make in their sleep. If you see anything like that, let us know immediately.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; Alison said before Taneem could answer. &#x201c;Okay, the MixStar&#x2019;s running. I&#x2019;ll go find a spot for the tracer.&#x201d; She reappeared from the van and jogged over to the rear of the nearest shuttle, ducking beneath its engine section.<br>This was the part that Taneem still didn&#x2019;t quite understand. The tracer would do them no good attached to the shuttle. Jack, Alison, and Draycos all knew that. So, presumably, would Colonel Frost.<br>Yet Alison seemed to think Frost might not think Jack and Alison knew that. She had tried to explain that Frost might therefore believe that was the reason why she and Taneem had invaded the hangar this way.<br>It would be simpler if they never knew Alison and Taneem had been here at all. But Taneem had to admit that was probably impossible. Not with the Brummgas having been put to sleep this way.<br>There was so much she still had to learn.<br>&#x201c;Alison!&#x201d; Jack&#x2019;s voice snapped with sudden urgency in Taneem&#x2019;s ear. &#x201c;More traffic heading your way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I thought Uncle Virge said there were only twenty-five vans on the Chookoock grounds,&#x201d; Alison said.<br>&#x201c;These aren&#x2019;t vans, they&#x2019;re cars,&#x201d; Jack gritted out. &#x201c;Four of them, loaded to the gills with humans.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And,&#x201d; Draycos put in tautly, &#x201c;Frost and Neverlin are among them.&#x201d;<br>Excerpted from DRAGON AND LIBERATOR by Timothy Zahn.<br>Copyright � 2008 by Timothy Zahn.<br>Published in June 2008 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC.<br>All rights reserved.

Her bestselling mystery series features laid-back First Century detective Marcus Didius Falco and his partner Helena Justina, plus friends, relations, pets and bitter enemy the Chief Spy. Her books are translated into many languages and serialised on BBC Radio 4. Past Chair of the Crimewriters' Association and a Vice President of the Classical Association, she has won the CWA Ellis Peters Historical Dagger, the Dagger in the Library, and a Sherlock award for Falco as Best Comic Detective. She was born in Birmingham but now lives in London.It's the reign of Emperor Vespasian in first century Rome, and informer/spy/p.i. Marcus Didius Falco (Time to Depart, 1997, etc.) has taken a partnerlongtime friend Petronius Longus, dismissed from Rome's Fourth Cohort unit of police; living apart from wife Silvia; and infatuated with Milvia, wife of gangster Florius. (Falco, meanwhile, is happy with his loving, clever Helena and their baby daughter.) The new partners are by the Tailor Lane water fountain one day when a human hand is found by a worker. It soon develops that various body parts, all female, have been turning up in the aqueduct system over a period of time, always after one of Rome's frequent festivals. The Curator of Aqueducts is now taking the matter seriously, putting it in the hands of his Chief Spy Anacrites (anathema to Falco), assistant engineer Bolanus, and ex-consul Julius Frontinus, just appointed to the governorship of Britain. The third hand to surface wears a ring, and before long an identification is made: the victim was Asinia, wife of Caius Cicurrus, who never arrived home after attending one of the Festival Games. It becomes apparent to the investigating team that what's happening must have its origins in the countryside and hills outside Rome where the Aqueducts are fed. Falco makes extensive forays into the area, looking for those citizens who frequent Rome at Festival times, but it takes the disappearance of Claudia, fiance of Helena's brother, to send Falco on a last journey to the countrysideand to a final confrontation with a killer. Falco, less of a wise-guy in this outing, is mellowing with his new family. The puzzle and its resolution are only marginally convincing, but the evocation of ancient Romealmost street by streetshould prove a treasure to readers interested in the era. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He was a pimp and this is his story, told without bitterness and with no pretence at moralizing - the smells, the sounds, the fears, the petty triumphs in the world of the pimp. He was young, ambitious and blessed with a superior IQ. He lived the Game for 25 years of his life, knocking out prostitutes, building up stables, losing himself on scag, proving himself to be the biggest mack in Chicago. It was a life of ups and downs, and to succeed you had to be utterly ruthless. Few survived - Iceberg did. Robert Beck is the author of &#34;Trick Baby&#34;, &#34;Death Wish&#34;, &#34;Mama Black Widow&#34; and &#34;Airtight Willie&#34;.</p><p>Iceberg Slim, also known as Robert Beck, was born in Chicago in 1918 and was initiated into the life of the pimp at age eighteen. He briefly attended the Tuskegee Institute but dropped out to return to the streets of the South Side, where he remained, pimping until he was forty-two. After several stints in jail he decided to give up the life and turned to writing. Slim folded his life into the pages of seven books based on his life. Catapulted into the public eye, Slim became a new American hero, known for speaking the truth whether that truth was ugly, sexy, rude, or blunt. He published six more books based on his life and Slim died at age 73 in 1992; one day before the Los Angeles riots.Pimp PREFACE<p></p> <br>In this book I will take you, the reader, with me into the secret inner world of the pimp. I will lay bare my life and thoughts as a pimp. The account of my brutality and cunning as a pimp will fill many of you with revulsion, however, if one intelligent, valuable young man or woman can be saved from the destructive slime; then the displeasure I have given will have been outweighed by that individual&#x2019;s use of his potential in a socially constructive manner.<br> <br>I regret that it is impossible to recount to you all of my experiences as a pimp. Unfortunately, it would require the combined pages of a half-dozen books. Perhaps my remorse for my ghastly life will diminish to the degree that within this one book I have been allowed to purge myself. Perhaps one day I can win respect as a constructive human being. Most of all I wish to become a decent example for my children and for that wonderful woman in the grave, my mother.|Pimp EPILOGUE<p></p> <br>I am lying in the quiet dawn. I am writing this last chapter for the publisher.<br> <br>I am thinking, &#x201c;How did a character like me, who for most of his life had devoted himself to the vilest career, ever square up? By all the odds, I should have ended a broken, diseased shell, or died in a lonely prison cell.&#x201d;<br> <br>I guess three of the very important reasons are lying asleep in the bedroom across the hall. I can see their peaceful, happy faces. They don&#x2019;t know how hard and often discouraging it is for me to earn a living for them in the square world.<br> <br>This square world is a strange place for me. For the last five years I have tried hard, so hard, to solve its riddles, to fit in.<br> <br>Catherine, my beautiful wife, is wonderful and courageous. She&#x2019;s a perfect mother to our adorable two-year-old girl, and our sturdy, handsome three-year-old boy.<br> <br>In this new world that isn&#x2019;t really square at all, I have had many bitter experiences. I remember soon after my marriage how optimistic I was as I set out to apply for the sales jobs listed in the want ads.<br> <br>I knew that I was a stellar salesman. After all, hadn&#x2019;t I proved my gift for thirty years? The principles of selling are the same in both worlds. The white interviewers were impressed by my bearing and apparent facility with words. They sensed my knowledge of human nature.<br> <br>But they couldn&#x2019;t risk the possible effect that a Negro&#x2019;s presence would have on the firm&#x2019;s all white personnel. In disgust and anger, I would return home and sulk. Bitterly I would try to convince myself to go back into the rackets. Catherine always said the right things and gave me her love and understanding.<br> <br>There was another indispensable source of help and courage during these hard times. She&#x2019;s a charming, brilliant woman. She had been a friend to my mother. She functioned as a kind of psychotherapist. She explained and pointed out to me the mental phases I was passing through. She gave me insight to fight the battle. To her I shall always be grateful.<br> <br>The story of my life indicates that my close friends were few. Shortly before I started this book I met a man I respected. I thought he was a true friend. I was bitterly disillusioned to discover he wasn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m glad in a way it turned out the way it did. I&#x2019;ve always come back stronger after a good kick in the ass.<br> <br>I have had many interesting and even humorous experiences in this new life. They will have to wait for now. I see my little family is awake. I&#x2019;ll have to light the heater. I can&#x2019;t let them get up in the early morning chill.<br> <br>How about it, an Iceberg with a warm heart?|Pimp 1<br>TORN FROM THE NEST<p></p> <br>Her name was Maude and she Georgied me around 1921. I was only three years old. Mama told me about it, and always when she did her rage and indignation would be as strong and as emotional perhaps as at the time when she had surprised her, panting and moaning at the point of orgasm with my tiny head wedged between her ebony thighs, her massive hands viselike around my head.<br> <br>Mama worked long hours in a hand laundry and Maude had been hired as a babysitter at fifty cents a day. Maude was a young widow. Strangely, she had a reputation in Indianapolis, Indiana as a devout Holy Roller.<br> <br>I have tried through the years to remember her face but all I can remember is the funky ritual. I vaguely remember, not her words but her excitement when we were alone.<br> <br>I remember more vividly the moist, odorous darkness and the bristle-like hairs tickling my face and most vividly I can remember my panic, when in the wild moment of her climax, she would savagely jerk my head even tighter into the hairy maw.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t get a breath of air until like a huge black balloon she would exhale with a whistling whoosh and relax, limply freeing my head.<br> <br>I remember the ache of the strain on my fragile neck muscles, and especially at the root of my tongue.<br> <br>Mama and I had come to Indianapolis from Chicago, where since the time when she was six months pregnant, my father had begun to show his true colors as an irresponsible, white-spats-wearing bum.<br> <br>Back in that small town in Tennessee, their home town, he had stalked the beautiful virgin and conned her into marriage. Her parents, with vast relief, gave their blessing and wished them the best in the promised land up North in Chicago.<br> <br>Mama had ten brothers and sisters. Her marriage meant one less mouth to feed.<br> <br>My father&#x2019;s father was a skilled cook and he passed his know how to my father, who shortly after getting to Chicago scored a chef&#x2019;s job at a huge middle-class hotel. Mama was put on as a waitress.<br> <br>Mama told me that even with both of them working twelve hours a day, six days a week they couldn&#x2019;t save a nickel or buy furniture or anything.<br> <br>My idiot father had come to the big city and gone sucker wild. He couldn&#x2019;t stay away from the high-yellow whores with their big asses and bitch-dog sexual antics. What they didn&#x2019;t con him out of he lost in the cheat crap joints.<br> <br>At the hotel one night he vanished from the kitchen. Mama finally found him thrusting mightily into a half-white waitress lying on a sack of potatoes in a storage room, with her legs locked around his back.<br> <br>Mama said she threw everything she could lift at them. They were unemployed when they walked away from the shambles.<br> <br>My father tearfully vowed to straighten himself out and be a man, but he didn&#x2019;t have the will, the strength to resist the cheap thrills of the city.<br> <br>After my birth he got worse and had the stupid gall to suggest to Mama that I be put on a Catholic Church doorstep. Mama naturally refused so he hurled me against the wall in disgust.<br> <br>I survived it and he left us, his white spats flashing and his derby hat at a rakish angle.<br> <br>It was the beginning of a bitter winter. Mama packed pressing irons and waving combs into a small bag and wrapped me warmly in blankets and set out into the bleak, friendless city to ring door bells, the bag in one arm and I in the other.<br> <br>Her pitch was something like this, &#x201c;Madam, I can make your hair curly and beautiful. Please give me a chance. For fifty cents, that&#x2019;s all, I will make your hair shine like new money.&#x201d;<br> <br>At this point in the pitch Mama told me she would slip the blanket aside to bare my wee big-eyed face. The sight of me in her arm on a subzero day was like a charm. She managed to make a living for us.<br> <br>That spring, with new friends of Mama&#x2019;s we left Chicago for Indianapolis. We stayed there until nineteen twenty-four, when a fire gutted the hand laundry where Mama worked.<br> <br>There were no jobs in Indianapolis for Mama and for six months we barely made it on the meager savings. We were penniless and with hardly any food when a tall black angel visiting relatives in Indianapolis came into our lives.<br> <br>He fell instantly in love with my lissome beautiful mother. His name was Henry Upshaw, and I guess I fell as hard for him as he fell for Mama.<br> <br>He took us back to Rockford, Illinois with him where he owned a cleaning and pressing shop, the only Negro business in downtown Rockford.<br> <br>In those tough depression times a Negro in his position was the envy of most Negro men.<br> <br>Henry was religious, ambitious, good and kind. I often wonder what would have happened to my life if I had not been torn from him.<br> <br>He treated Mama like she was a princess, anything she wanted he got for her. She was a fashion plate all right.<br> <br>Every Sunday when we all three went to church in the gleaming black Dodge we were an outstanding sight as we walked down the aisle in our fresh neat clothing.<br> <br>Only the few Negro lawyers and physicians lived as well, looked as well. Mama was president of several civic clubs. For the first time we were living the good life.<br> <br>Mama had a dream. She told it to Henry. Like the genie of the lamp he made it a reality.<br> <br>It was a four stall, opulent beauty shop. Its chrome gleamed in the black-and-gold motif. It was located in the heart of the Negro business section and it flourished from the moment its doors opened.<br> <br>Her clientele was for the most part whores, pimps, and hustlers from the sprawling red light district in Rockford. They were the only ones who always had the money to spend on their appearance.<br> <br>The first time I saw Steve he was sitting getting his nails manicured in the shop. Mama was smiling into his handsome olive-tinted face as she buffed his nails.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know when I first saw him that he was the pin-striped snake who would poison the core of our lives.<br> <br>I certainly had no inkling that last day at the shop as live billows of steam hissed from the old pressing machine each time Henry slammed its lid down on a garment.<br> <br>Jesus! It was hot in that little shop, but I loved every minute of it. It was school-vacation time for me and every summer I worked in the shop all day, every day helping my stepfather.<br> <br>That day as I saw my reflection on the banker&#x2019;s expensive black shoes, I was perhaps the happiest black boy in Rockford. As I applied the sole dressing I hummed my favorite tune &#x201c;Spring Time in the Rockies.&#x201d;<br> <br>The banker stepped down from the shine stand, stood for a moment as I flicked lint from his soft, rich suit, then with a warm smile he pressed an extravagant fifty-cent piece into my hand and stepped out into the broiling street.<br> <br>Now I whistled my favorite tune, shines were only a dime, what a tip.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know at the time that the banker would never press another coin into my hand, that for the next thirty-five years this last day would be remembered vividly as the final day of real happiness for me.<br> <br>I would press five-dollar bills into the palms of shine boys. My shoes would be handmade, would cost three times as much as the banker&#x2019;s shoes, but my shoes, though perfectly fitted would be worn in tension and fear.<br> <br>There was really nothing out of the ordinary that day. Nothing during that day that I heard or saw that prepared me for the swift, confusing events that over the weekend would slam my life away from all that was good to all that was bad.<br> <br>Now, looking back remembering that last day in the shop as clearly as if it were yesterday, my stepfather, Henry, was unusually quiet. My young mind couldn&#x2019;t grasp his worry, his heart break.<br> <br>Even I, a ten year old, knew that this huge, ugly, black man who had rescued Mama and me from actual starvation back in Indianapolis loved us with all of his great, sensitive heart.<br> <br>I loved Henry with all my heart. He was the only father I had ever really known.<br> <br>He could have saved himself an early death from a broken heart if instead of falling so madly in love with Mama he had run as fast as he could away from her. For him, she was brown-skin murder in a size-twelve dress.<br> <br>That last night at eight o&#x2019;clock Dad and I flicked the shop&#x2019;s lights out as always at closing.<br> <br>In an emotion muffled voice he spoke my name &#x201c;Bobby.&#x201d;<br> <br>I turned toward him and looked up into his face tense and strained in the pale light from the street lamp. I was confused and shaken when he put his massive hands on my shoulders and drew me to him very tightly just holding me in this strange desperate way.<br> <br>My head was pressed against his belt buckle. I could barely hear his low, rapid flow of pitiful words.<br> <br>He said, &#x201c;Bobby, you know I love you and Mama, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>His stomach muscles were cording, jerking against my cheek. I knew he was going to burst into tears.<br> <br>I said as I squeezed my arms around his waist, &#x201c;Yes, Daddy, yes, Daddy. We love you too, Daddy. We always will, Daddy.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was trembling as he said, &#x201c;You and Mama wouldn&#x2019;t ever leave me? You know Bobby, I ain&#x2019;t got nobody in the world but you two. I just couldn&#x2019;t go on if you left me alone.&#x201d;<br> <br>I clung tightly to him and said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry Daddy, we&#x2019;ll never leave you, I promise, honest, Daddy.&#x201d;<br> <br>What a sight we must have been, the six-foot-six black giant and the frail little boy holding on to each other for dear life, crying there in the darkness.<br> <br>I tell you when we finally made it to the big black Dodge and were riding home my thoughts were turning madly.<br> <br>Yes, poor Henry&#x2019;s fears had foundation. Mama had never loved my stepfather. This kind, wonderful man had only been a tool of convenience. She had fallen in love with the snake all right.<br> <br>His plan was to cop Mama and make it to the Windy. The dirty bastard knew I would be excess baggage, but the way Mama was gulping his con, he figured he could get rid of me later.<br> <br>Only after I had become a pimp years later would I know Steve&#x2019;s complete plot, and how stupid he really was.<br> <br>Here this fool had a smart, square broad with a progressive square-john husband, infatuated with him. Her business was getting better all the time.<br> <br>Her sucker husband was blindly in love, and the money from his business was wide open to her. If Steve had been clever he could have stayed right there on top of things and bled a big bankroll from the businesses in a couple of years.<br> <br>Then he could have pulled Mama out of there and with a big bankroll he could have done anything with her, even turned her out.<br> <br>I tell you she was that hot for him. She had to be insane over the asshole to walk away from all that potential with only twenty-five hundred in cash.<br> <br>Steve blew it in a Georgia-skin game within a week after we got to Chicago.<br> <br>I have wished to Christ, in four penitentiaries, that the lunatic lovers had left me in Rockford with Henry when they split.<br> <br>One scene in my life I can never forget and that was that morning when Mama had finished packing our clothes and Henry lost his inner fight for his pride and dignity.<br> <br>He fell down on his knees and bawled like a scalded child, pleading with Mama not to leave him, begging her to stay. He had welded his arms around her legs, his voice hoarse in anguish, as he whimpered his love for us.<br> <br>His agonized eyes walled up at her as he wailed, &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t leave me. You are sure to kill me if you do. I ain&#x2019;t done nothing. If I have, forgive me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I will never forget her face, as cold as an executioner&#x2019;s, which she was, as she kicked and struggled loose from him.<br> <br>Then with an awful grin on her face she lied and said, &#x201c;Henry, Honey, I just want to get away for a while. Darling, we&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d;<br> <br>In his state she was lucky he hadn&#x2019;t killed her and me, and buri...</p><h2>Giuliano Bugialli&#39;s Foods of Italy</h2><p>The author shares anecdotes about each of the 125 recipes collected, which represent an extensive menu of vegetables, grains, fish, meat, poultry, game, fruits, and desserts drawn from the classic cuisine of Italy</p><p>The internationally acclaimed chef presents more than 125 classic Italian recipes. <p></p><p>Copyright 1994 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Norman Saunders</h2><p>This spectacular new 368-page hardcover monograph is the <b>catalog raisonne</b> of the extensive career of the legendary artist Norman Saunders.

Timpanogos beckons the urban populace of Utah. And yet, no &#x201c;Indian&#x201d; legend graced the mount until Mormon settlers conjured it&#x2014;once they had displaced the local Indians, the Utes, from their actual landmark, Utah Lake. <i>On Zion&#x2019;s Mount</i> tells the story of this curious shift. It is a quintessentially American story about the fraught process of making oneself &#x201c;native&#x201d; in a strange land. But it is also a complex tale of how cultures confer meaning on the environment&#x2014;how they create homelands. </p><p> Only in Utah did Euro-American settlers conceive of having a homeland in the Native American sense&#x2014;an endemic spiritual geography. They called it &#x201c;Zion.&#x201d; Mormonism, a religion indigenous to the United States, originally embraced Indians as &#x201c;Lamanites,&#x201d; or spiritual kin. <i>On Zion&#x2019;s Mount</i> shows how, paradoxically, the Mormons created their homeland at the expense of the local Indians&#x2014;and how they expressed their sense of belonging by investing Timpanogos with &#x201c;Indian&#x201d; meaning. </p><p> This same pattern was repeated across the United States. Jared Farmer reveals how settlers and their descendants (the new natives) bestowed &#x201c;Indian&#x201d; place names and recited pseudo-Indian legends about those places&#x2014;cultural acts that still affect the way we think about American Indians and American landscapes. </p></p><p>Jared Farmer is Assistant Professor of History at The State University of New York at Stony Brook, and author of <i>Glen Canyon Dammed: Inventing Lake Powell and the Canyon Country</i>.This stunningly original book proves that geography and our sense of place are mere creations of history, and with it Jared Farmer has proven himself a brilliant trailblazer of the past in the Wallace Stegner tradition. <br> --Francis Parkman Prize Committee, Society of American Historians<br><br>Magnificent historical storytelling, both fun and provocative. Ostensibly framed around the creation of a landmark peak in the American West, <i>On Zion's Mount</i> details the production of memory in the service of forgetting. Transcending the parochial nature of older Utah and Mormon histories, Farmer constructs an intellectual universe around the Mormon-Ute contest for place. He traces the physical and folkloric fallout of that complex history through to twentieth-century raconteurs, promoters, and developers who continued to reinvent the cultural landscape. Farmer is unflinching in his loving but pointed critique of a culture that venerates history and simultaneously clings to historical forgetfulness.<br> --David Rich Lewis, Utah State University<br><br>Few books can match the intellectual pleasure and wonderful writing of this study. Jared Farmer helps us see a world filled with landmarks that we construct in our heads and through our actions. His insights sparkle on every page.<br> --Clyde A. Milner II, editor, <i>A New Significance: Re-envisioning the History of the American West</i><br><br>Beginning with a striking mountain in Utah, <i>On Zion's Mount</i> opens up a world of connections between landscape, folklore, history, and pop culture. In witty, lucid prose, Jared Farmer illuminates the legends Americans wove to possess Indian land. A great read, this brilliant book will intrigue anyone interested in the past, present, and future of the land we live with and weave stories about.<br> --Alan Taylor, author of <i>The Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution</i><br><br>This multilayered, beautifully written story explains how nature alone does not create landscapes; people are always complicit. There is no better introduction to this region and to the cultural formation of landscapes than Farmer's work.<br> --Richard Lyman Bushman, author of <i>Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling</i><br><br>Jared Farmer has given us a rich, graceful environmental history, all five senses engaged. With the warmth of a native son, the passionate curiosity of a born scholar, and the perfect pitch of the master storyteller, Farmer introduces us to the heart of Utah, a place long inhabited, used, fought over, mystified, stolen, mythologized, and, it seems, deliberately forgotten. <i>On Zion's Mount</i> is riveting, a joy to read and to pass along to devotees of the American West.<br> --Virginia Scharff, author of <i>Twenty Thousand Roads: Women, Movement, and the West</i><br><br>Farmer's brilliant study of the rise and fall of two linked landmarks--Utah Lake and Mt. Timpanogos--opens up the history and memory of American place-making in exciting new ways.<br> --Philip Deloria, author of <i>Playing Indian</i><br><br>An intriguing and original book, well written, refreshingly accessible and often entertaining. It is both a history and a meditation on places, memories, and changing identities. I don't know of another book quite like it. <br> --Elliott West, author of <i>The Contested Plains: Indians, Goldseekers, and the Rush to Colorado</i><br><br><i>On Zion&#x2019;s Mount</i> is a well-researched, thoughtful exploration of how landscape is produced by societies as a result of certain historical conditions. The book deserves praise for challenging memories that are built on first forgetting.<br> --Tom Harvey (<i>Salt Lake Tribune</i> 2008-06-28)<br><br>This is not a conventional history of Mormon-Indian relations during the second half of the 19th century. Rather, Farmer offers an intellectual interpretation of the Utah Valley and its most identifiable landmark--Mount Timpanogos, which towers above Provo and Orem. He also explains how white people (mostly Mormons) created pseudo-Indian legends that strengthened white claims while reducing the indigenous Ute attachment to the landscape...[Farmer] compares similar legends throughout the nation and explains how they were created to reflect the prevailing ideologies of the day. As an intellectual and cultural investigation, this book ably weaves diverse fabrics of history and folklore into an understandable whole.<br> --M. L.

A new Golden Age of peace, enlightenment and prosperity has dawned. Gloriana is Albion and Albion is Gloriana; if one falls, so too will the other. And Gloriana is oppressed by the burden this places upon her - and by the fact that she remains incapable of orgasm. The maintenance of the delicate balance that keeps Albion and Gloriana thriving depends of Montfallcon, Gloriana&#39;s Chancellor, and on his network of spies and assassins - in particular on Quire, cold hearted seducer of virtue and murderer of innocence. When Quire falls out with Montfallcon, he forms an alliance with his greatest enemy and conceives a plan to ruin Gloriana, destroy Albion, the empire and the Golden Age itself. But even the utterly ruthless Quire does not fully understand what he has set in motion when he persuades the Queen to fall in love with him...Moorcock&#39;s masterly evocation of Gloriana&#39;s strange and secretive palace and of a vibrant London make this one of his most powerful and memorable novels.</p><p>SALES POINTS * Part of the Fantasy Masterworks series * &#39;A great read...fiction writing at its best; a craftsman in full possession of his powers as Moorcock is here is a joy&#39; Maxim Jakubowski, Vector * &#39;He is a giant.

The one person who can help Ryan is a mysterious old lawyer named Hezekiah. Hezekiah may have magical powers, or he may have the most elaborate computerized law library ever conceived. Either way, together, Ryan and Hezekiah do their legal research by zooming through leapholes, physically entering the law books, and coming face-to-face with actual people from some of our nation&#39;s most famous cases-like Rosa Parks and Dred Scott-who will help Ryan defend himself in court. It is time travel with a legal twist, where law books and important legal precedents come to life.</p><p>On April 19, 1841, the American ship William Brown hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic while en route from Liverpool to Philadelphia. It was loaded with Irish emigrants. Roughly half the passengers went down with the ship, and the rest piled into two lifeboats. The boat commanded by the first mate was so badly overloaded that it began to sink. In the face of crashing waves and a driving rainstorm, the first mate in utter desperation ordered his crew to lighten the load. Twelve men and two women were thrown overboard and drowned at sea. When the survivors finally reached land, one of the crewmen who had thrown passengers overboard faced criminal charges. It was undisputed that the lifeboat would have sunk and all would have perished if it had remained in its overloaded state. However, the American judge who decided the prisoner&#39;s fate wrote that the passengers should have cast lots to determine who should live and who should die. This opinion sparked sharp debate among jurists and legal scholars. Some believed that casting lots was fair, almost an appeal to God. Others believed that casting lots was effectively &#34;playing God,&#34; a practice that dehumanized all of us. The case of The William Brown has fascinated me since law school. It presents the ultimate survival dilemma -- to save ourselves or to save others. That dilemma is a theme that runs throughout Leapholes. Eleven-year-old Ryan Coolidge is forced to confront that issue head on. But he does it in a way he had never imagined he would. Ryan encounters a magical lawyer who puts a new spin on time travel -- a lawyer with the power of legal &#34;leapholes,&#34; the power to bring to life the people behind famous legal decisions like The William Brown. All of the cases woven into the Leapholes storyline are actual cases from American legal history. The case of The William Brown is reported at United States v. Holmes (1842). The Supreme Court&#39;s decision that slaves are property, not people, appears at Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857). The slave doctrine that &#34;the brood follows the dam&#34; was embraced by the U.S. Supreme Court in Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842). I&#39;ve tried to present these and other snippets of legal history in a way that makes for exciting reading. Hopefully, it will provoke thoughtful discussion, not only about the law, but also about the people whose lives were affected by the thousands of reported decisions in our law libraries. It&#39;s a fun way to discover that legal precedents are not just words on paper. They are about real people with real problems. And for many, the law was a matter of life and death.This book is a terrific way to introduce young readers to the legal concept of precedents and case law. The unique concept of "leapholes" will appeal to anyone, young or old, who may enjoy experiencing important legal decisions through the eyes, minds and souls of the people who lived those historic events.

The language is as expertly crafted as the master locksmith's models in the story, and the settings as intricately evoked. A compelling and uplifting novel."--M.L. Stedman, author of The Light Between Oceans<br><br>"This jewel of a story is put together like a vintage timepiece, its many threads coming together so perfectly. Doerr's writing and imagery are stunning. It's been a while since a novel had me under its spell in this fashion. The story still lives on in my head."--Abraham Verghese, author of Cutting for Stone<br><br>""All the Light We Cannot See" is a dazzling, epic work of fiction. Anthony Doerr writes beautifully about the mythic and the intimate, about snails on beaches and armies on the move, about fate and love and history and those breathless, unbearable moments when they all come crashing together."--Jess Walter, author of Beautiful Ruins<br><br>"Doerr sees the world as a scientist, but feels it as a poet. He knows about everything"--radios, diamonds, mollusks, birds, flowers, locks, guns--but he also writes a line so beautiful, creates an image or scene so haunting, it makes you think forever differently about the big things--love, fear, cruelty, kindness, the countless facets of the human heart. Wildly suspenseful, structurally daring, rich in detail and soul, Doerr's new novel is that" novel, the one you savor, and ponder, and happily lose sleep over, then go around urging all your friends to read--now."--J.R.

Oddsmakers give Sean Drummond zero chance of saving his client from a death sentence. However, his obligation runs deeper than simply professional: Morrison&#39;s wife, a CIA executive, has begged Sean to save her husband, and Drummond doesn&#39;t want to disappoint his old flame. Despite ever-more-damning intelligence leaks that paint Morrison as worse than Bene- dict Arnold, Drummond bulls ahead and comes to suspect that this simple case of treason is actually a chess game being played at the highest levels by the best and brightest-one in which Morrison is merely a pawn.</p><p>Brian Haig is the author of two previous novels that feature Sean Drummond- Secret Sanction and Mortal Allies. He lives in Pennington, New Jersey.THE KINGMAKER, third in the Drummond adventure series, pits military lawyer Sean Drummond against a shadow regime.

The officer followed Charm over the course of the next couple of months, leading Jamar to videotape and take notes on the cop and his partner. The next thing Louise hears, Jamar got in a fight and is killed in the projects by local hoods. It doesn't add up: he was a straight A student, destined for better things, until he began to ask too many questions about the racist police force. <br>Leonard, a tough black gay Vietnam vet and Republican, joins Hap in the investigation, and they stumble upon the racial divides that have shaped their Eastern Texas town. But if anyone can navigate these pitfalls and bring the killers to justice, it's Hap and Leonard.<br>Filled with Lansdale's trademark whip-smart dialogue, colorful characters, and relentless pacing, <i>Rusty Puppy</i> is Joe Lansdale at his page-turning best.</p><p><b>Joe R.

As always, Lansdale spins a wild, rollicking yarn, but behind all the mayhem is a heartfelt tale about friendship, brotherhood, loyalty, and family. Hap andLeonard are complicated, violent men, but they display a basic humanity and decency that carries this remarkable series along."&#x2015;<b><i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></b><br><br>"A unique mix of sly humor and horrific violence.

Another fine entry in a great series."&#x2015;<b><i>Booklist (starred review)</i></b><br><br>"The pleasure of any Hap and Leonard mystery is the yin-yang of the two heroes: white/black, straight/gay, liberal/conservative, easygoing/hair-trigger temper. Without making any brotherhood speeches, the books are rough-hewn fables of tolerance in action. Part of the reason it all goes down without any kind of 'Kumbaya' ickiness is that Lansdale writes such good smart-ass repartee. . . . This puppy tells a waggly tale the reader is happy to follow down the roughest paths."&#x2015;<b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>"Joe R. Lansdale has a wicked way with words. Hap Collins and Leonard Pine, small-town East Texas private detectives, say the filthiest things. Some of it is good-natured banter between buddies; the rest is don't-mess-with-me trash talk. And they don't just talk dirty. They fight dirty, too. One almost feels guilty enjoying their raw, rollicking adventures.

The Jeff Davis 8 had been among society&#x2019;s most vulnerable&#x2014;impoverished, abused, and mired with mental illness. They engaged in sex work as a means of survival.

Hell, some of the songs are actually Irish.<br>I was there that Thursday, sitting in my favorite booth&#x2014;back middle, just under the picture of the big, grinning Chinese fellow with the mustache and the cowboy hat&#x2014;while I waited for the rest of my band, the Jig-Makers, to finish tuning. It&#x2019;s my favorite booth because you can see the whole dining room to your right and most of the taproom to your left, and you get a great view of the stage.<br>We weren&#x2019;t playing tonight, but Fred, the manager, let us use the stage to practice. The place used to have live music every Wednesday and Thursday, as well as on the weekends, but it didn&#x2019;t pay, so Fred canceled it. He was the practical sort; not me, I&#x2019;m sentimental. This has caused me any number of difficulties, but there it is. My other problem is that I&#x2019;m easily distracted. Sorry about that. Where was I? Oh, yeah. Thursday. Which reminds me: Did you hear the one about how, after the nuclear attack, the town of Sanctuary, Venus, had to change its name? To Sanctuary, Jupiter? Anyway, Thursday was the day someone lobbed an atomic warhead at Jerrysport, Mars, and reduced it to rubble.<br>It was damned uncomfortable when the bomb hit; we must have been within a mile or so of ground zero. If we&#x2019;d been much closer that would have been it for us, and I might never have found out what goats are really useful for, but it wasn&#x2019;t, so I did and maybe I&#x2019;ll tell you. In any case, I was knocked to the floor, and then I rolled and something fell on me and I blacked out for a while. It hurt to wake up again, but I didn&#x2019;t mind too much, since I was having a confused dream about Irish ghosts and they all looked like geeks.<br>Fully conscious, I decided I wasn&#x2019;t injured, since a headache doesn&#x2019;t count as an injury. Diffuse, pale light came in through the frosted windows high on what had been the west wall when the place was built and the north wall in Ibrium City and the south wall in London and Jerrysport. The room contained vast quantities of ambient dust. I thought about my band over in the taproom, but they were safer there than I was here, as long as the pool tables didn&#x2019;t start flying around. I was pleased I remembered them; one effect the jump has, we&#x2019;ve learned, is disorientation, to a greater or lesser degree. I&#x2019;m not sure why. After the first one, it took me a few days to remember even the most basic things, and a month later there were still bits and pieces coming back. And with the jostling we&#x2019;d gotten lately, it was bound to be pretty bad.<br>I pulled myself up to a sitting position and looked around. Fortunately or unfortunately, there had been no customers in the place, but that wasn&#x2019;t surprising, as I&#x2019;ve found that business always slacks off when there&#x2019;s a nuclear alert in a city.<br>Someone said, &#x201c;You all right, Billy?&#x201d;<br>Billy? I blinked twice. Yeah, that was me. I looked for the voice, and spotted a likely-looking pile of debris&#x2014;likely-looking mostly because it was moving. I stood up, decided I weighed more than I should, and sat down. I tried again, took a couple of deep breaths, and helped remove a table, tablecloth, and part of a booth from Rich Vonderick, who had a neatly trimmed beard, a bear-like build, and the personality of a rabid crocodile on Valium.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;You look a bit dusty, though.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What could have caused that?&#x201d; This was irony.<br>&#x201c;Something about an atomic warhead, I think.&#x201d; So was this.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. Then, suddenly, &#x201c;Eve!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s in back,&#x201d; I said quickly. &#x201c;I saw her just a minute or two before it hit.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; He relaxed. &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br>See that? I had trouble remembering who I was, but had no trouble remembering who Eve was, or where I&#x2019;d just seen her. Fascinating thing, the mind. I said, &#x201c;Glad you were here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You, too.&#x201d;<br>I snorted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to get left behind; I have too much to do.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Like what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Uhh...ask me tomorrow.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; He looked like he might be about to argue, but instead said, &#x201c;Where are we?&#x201d; as if I&#x2019;d know.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find out,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;When the place opens for business. Got your tool kit?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Always,&#x201d; he said, glancing around and spotting it. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll probably be useful in getting the lights working.&#x201d;<br>He nodded. &#x201c;Any idea who else made it through?&#x201d; There was a certain amount of tension in his voice; we&#x2019;ve both known people who happened not to be in the restaurant at the right time.<br>I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure everyone did.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Rich. &#x201c;In that case, how about if we ask Libby for a drink?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Drink?&#x201d; said someone behind me. I turned around in time to see a short, pretty, dark-haired woman walking in from the taproom.<br>&#x201c;Hey, sis,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How is everything?&#x201d; A moment later it occurred to me that she wasn&#x2019;t really my sister; I just called her that.<br>&#x201c;Hi, Rose,&#x201d; said Rich. &#x201c;How do you feel?&#x201d; Rose. That was it.<br>&#x201c;I need whiskey,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s the band?&#x201d; said Rich.<br>&#x201c;Jamie broke a D-string and the bridge on my fiddle collapsed and Tommy lost his last pick and we can&#x2019;t find the tipper for the bodhran and I need whiskey.&#x201d; She blinked twice by way of punctuation.<br>I said, &#x201c;But all the instruments are okay, right?&#x201d;<br>She cocked her head to the side and said, &#x201c;If the instruments weren&#x2019;t okay d&#x2019;you suppose I&#x2019;d be so calm?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; said Rich, who only pretended not to like our music. I think.<br>I said to Rose, &#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t scared or anything, are you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Noooo,&#x201d; she said patiently. &#x201c;I just need whiskey.&#x201d; Then she frowned. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t hear at first, though, and that scared me. And it sounds like you&#x2019;re talking through a tunnel, although it isn&#x2019;t as bad as it was a few minutes ago. And I forgot where this room was for a minute.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the jump,&#x201d; said Rich. &#x201c;My vision keeps going in and out. It probably will for a few days yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whiskey will help,&#x201d; said Rose confidently.<br>I went up to the hole in the wall where waitresses got drinks. Then I turned back and said, &#x201c;Libby isn&#x2019;t here. She was probably in back or something when it hit. I hope she&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll look,&#x201d; said Rich.<br>&#x201c;Nothing can happen to Libby,&#x201d; explained Rose patiently. &#x201c;She wouldn&#x2019;t allow it.&#x201d;<br>I tended to agree with her, though I couldn&#x2019;t say so. At that moment, however, I heard her in the kitchen calling to Fred to get the power switches. I felt tension go out of my shoulders. Then I wondered where the power switches were and it bothered me that I couldn&#x2019;</p><h2>The Art of Pilgrimage: A Seeker&#39;s Guide to Making Travel Sacred</h2><p><p><b><strong>On Literature, New Places, and the Sacred</strong></b></p><p><strong>Sacred travel guide.</strong>&nbsp;First published in 1998 and updated with a new preface by the author,&nbsp;<em>The Art of Pilgrimage</em>&nbsp;is a sacred travel guide full of inspiration for the spiritual traveler.</p><p><strong>Not just for pilgrims.</strong>&nbsp;We are descendants of nomads.

"At that crossroads moment, a voice calls to our pilgrim soul." Many have embarked upon a pilgrimage, but few have understood its mysteries and possibilities as well as Phil Cousineau does (author of <i>Soul Moments</i> and <i>The Hero's Journey</i>). On one level this is a highly useful guidebook packed with great ideas for enlightened traveling--tape recording local voices, music, and sounds; asking contemplative questions to waitresses and bookstore owners; lighting a traveling candle every morning; making an offering to the local deity. But most compelling is Cousineau's ability to expertly map the interior landscape of a pilgrimage--the sights that lead to insights and the borders that lead to breakthroughs as we trek the exterior landscape of our planet. --<i>Gail Hudson</i><p><strong>Phil Cousineau</strong>&nbsp;is an award-winning writer and filmmaker, teacher and editor, lecturer, storyteller and TV host.

Born into a poor family, he was adopted at the age of five and went to live in a country temple. He trained in many temples before starting a family at the age of thirty. At forty, he returned to the priesthood again, and eventually came to study with the Soto priest Harada Sogaku. Under this teacher, Hakuun&#39;s practice deepened, and he went on to teach monks and lay practitioners. He authored almost one hundred volumes of writings.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Japanese</p><h2>The George Gershwin Reader (Readers on American Musicians)</h2><p>George Gershwin is one of the giants of American music, unique in that he was both a brilliant writer of popular songs ("Swanee," "I Got Rhythm," "They Can't Take That Away From Me") and of more serious music, including "Rhapsody in Blue," "An American in Paris," and "Porgy and Bess." Now, in <em>The George Gershwin Reader</em>, music lovers are treated to a spectacular celebration of this great American composer. <br> The <em>Reader</em> offers a kaleidoscopic collection of writings by and about Gershwin, including more than eighty pieces of superb variety, color, and depth. There is a who's who of famous commentators: bandleader Paul Whiteman; critics Robert Benchley, Alexander Woollcott, and Brooks Atkinson; fellow musicians Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, Alec Wilder (who analyzes the songs "That Certain Feeling" and "A Foggy Day"), Leonard Bernstein, and the formidable modernist composer Arnold Schoenberg (who was Gershwin's tennis partner in Hollywood). Some of the most fascinating and important writings here deal with the critical debate over Gershwin's concert pieces, especially "Rhapsody in Blue" and "An American in Paris," and there is a complete section devoted to the controversies over "Porgy and Bess," including correspondence between Gershwin and DuBose Hayward, the opera's librettist (a series of excerpts which illuminate the creative process), plus unique interviews with the original Porgy and Bess--Todd Duncan and Anne Brown. Sprinkled throughout the book are excerpts from Gershwin's own letters, which offer unique insight into this fascinating and charming man. Along with a detailed chronology of the composer's life, the editors provide informative introductions to each entry.<br> Here then is a book for anyone interested in American music. Scholars, performers, and Gershwin's legions of fans will find it an irresistible feast.</p><p><br><strong>Robert Wyatt</strong> is a concert pianist and Gershwin authority who is now Executive Director of the Cape Cod Conservatory of Music. <strong>John Andrew Johnson</strong> is Assistant Professor of Musicology in the Department of Fine Arts at Syracuse University.<br><br>"A fascinating collection of articles, biographical reminiscences, reviews, musical analyses, and letters relating to the life and music of George Gershwin." --<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"How refreshing and exciting to see once again these surprises--and more--from the Gershwin scrapbooks, archives, private collections (some lost), in one cornucopia; the sweeping life of a wonderful great American master." --Edward Jablonski, historian, co-author of <em>The Gershwin Years--George and</em> <em>Ira</em><p></p><br>"From early in Gershwin's career his music challenged Americans to rethink their assumptions about composition and performance, nationalism, cultural hierarchy, and the racial divide. Documenting that rethinking process, Wyatt and Johnson's reader also illuminates the life and legacy of one of American music's most charismatic figures." --Richard Crawford, University of Michigan<p></p><br>"A superb source book about a cornerstone figure in American Music...an indelible contribution to the very idea of American culture and how it got that way. Letters and pieces by Gershwin himself are prominent, but the book will go anywhere and everywhere to catch a glimpse of his raffish genius in the sunlight.... You get, then, Gershwin from many, if not all sides and seen through a huge variety of lenses."--<em>Buffalo News</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Gates Of Eden</h2><p>Recreates and reassesses the key events, developments, cultural and political dilemmas, and various movements and achievements of a turbulent decade</p><p>Morris Dickstein is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of English and Theatre at the CUNY Graduate Center and the author of Dancing in the Dark, an award-winning cultural history of the Great Depression, and Why Not Say What Happened, a memoir.

Wouldn't we all like to know what that's like? Well, it took Abram four years from the day he and his wife decided to build to the day they moved in, and this rather humorless account details the arduous process. More technical than anecdotal, the story unfolds through chapters that reveal how specific rooms progressed and certain systems were installed (heating and roofing, for instance). Norm was deeply involved in designing, developing, and constructing the house, and it must have been worth it, for theirs is a beautiful and special home that showcases high-quality workmanship. The book does an exemplary job of recognizing the artisans and technicians who worked through sometimes harsh weather conditions to complete the project. Illustrated with line drawings and photographs of the house at various stages of its construction, this is a book for the connoisseur. <i>Kathy Broderick</i></p><h2>The Power of Affirmations</h2><p>This book is an attempt to describe some suggested ways to understand thought process and mind dynamics along with exercises to help a person take positive control of his her thoughts</p><p></p><h2>Extreme Face Painting: 50 Friendly &amp; Fiendish Step-by-Step Demos</h2><p><p><b>Put a new face on fun!</b></p><p>No matter what your experience level, you can turn everyday faces into sweet, funny or frightening works of art that move, laugh, grow and always make people smile!

They were named World Champions at the World Bodypainting Festival in 2009.Gr 6 Up&#x2013;This is a guide for experienced artists ready to take their craft to the next level, instead of painting pictures on a face, like colors on a flat canvas. These instructions show how to use shading and highlights to shape a variety of frightening and whimsical forms. The authors open the book with basic information about materials, colors, and techniques. Then they demonstrate different projects, with the &#x201c;friendly&#x201d; faces first, and the &#x201c;fiendish&#x201d; ones in the back. Each entry has a full-page color photograph of the final product and smaller photos of each step in the painting process. Clearly written instructions appear below each photo. The book contains the standard faces, such as a butterfly mask, animal faces, and a clown face, as well as some unusual projects. Some of the fiendish visages are quite frightening. The book comes with an informative DVD where the authors demonstrate two of the face paintings from the book. As one brother does the painting, the other gives a running commentary of what he is doing and why. The projects in this book have more impact than those in the Usborne Book of Face Painting (Usborne, 2003), but are not necessarily harder to create. This is a great resource, especially for older children, teens, and adults.&#x2013;Donna Cardon, Provo City Library, UT. (c) Copyright 2010.

As with previous books, it&#x2019;s not a systematic survey but rather a quick skim&#x2014;so quick that some common suffixes, such as -ism and -ology, are left out, and others that do appear (specifically -ward, -ation, and -ery) aren&#x2019;t picked up in the closing summary chart. Cleary mentions root words but steers clear of more advanced topics such as parts of speech, contractions (which are covered elsewhere), or inflectional versus derivational suffixes. Vague as the guidelines sometimes are (&#x201c;N-E-S-S often shows / a certain quality, / Like awkwardness / and happiness / and kindness, to name three&#x201d;), younger readers, or older ones less familiar with the language, will come away with at least a sense of what these slippery lexical items look like and some of the purposes they serve.

So he spends 20 years and all of his money&nbsp;&nbsp;to build a tower to the sun. Using the largest rock in the world as the foundation, workers pile stone upon stone, beam over beam, building atop building, until the old man sits on top of the tower with his great grandson and feels the warmth of the sun shine on his face. Though now penniless, he is indeed, a rich man. Lush with the intricate detail that has become his hallmark, Colin Thompson's art invites repeated examination and yields its secrets subtly. His tower is an extraordinary pastiche of architectural prototypes from Stonehenge, Greek temples and the leaning tower of Pisa to the Chrysler Building and the Guggenheim Museum. This is Thompson's most provocative pictorial fantasy to date--and a moving fable for the environmentally conscious of all ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Colin Thompson is fast becoming a cult.&nbsp;&nbsp;His incredibly detailed pictures, packed with bizarre touches, worlds within worlds, and wondrous visual jokes, are addictive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin's book <b></b><b><i> Ruby </i></b><b></b>, an international hit, was linked to a contest with a real vintage automobile as the prize.&nbsp;&nbsp;His earlier titles include <b></b><b><i> The Paper Bag Prince </i></b><b></b>and <b></b><b><i> Looking for Atlantis </i></b><b></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving art school, and subsequently, the London School of Film Technique, Colin worked for a time at the BBC before moving to the Outer Herbrides, where he began twenty years of self-employment in ceramics.&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin now works full time as an author and illustrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;Grade 1-6. Thompson creates a futuristic world in which the Earth is shrouded in a yellow, polluted mist and only the "weakest wash of sunshine" comes through. The richest man in the world and his grandson set out to penetrate the fog in order to see the sun. Collecting buildings from every continent, they spend years fabricating a tower. Finally, the leaning tower of Pisa is set at its peak, and the sky grows lighter. Sitting next to his great-grandson, the man feels the "warmth of life shine on his skin." The outlook of this book can only be described as bleak with its stark, desolate cityscape; dreary apocalyptic sky; and slim hope of continued survival. The only bright bit of fun arrives with the building of the tower where Thompson's signature crowding of minute details allows readers to put aside the story's premise in favor of discovering every visual nuance and identifying famous buildings. And yet this distraction is obliterated by the final illustration with its desolate line of silhouetted people waiting for their climb up the now menacing structure that looms like a foreboding atomic mushroom cloud. Maybe young readers will be incensed at the implied downtrodden apathy of this world's general population. Maybe this book will serve to spark the imagination in older readers to find more far-reaching, positive solutions. There's a lot of potential for discussion here.?Martha Topol, Traverse Area District Library, Traverse City, MI<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American Reckoning: The Vietnam War and Our National Identity</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;Few people understand the centrality of the Vietnam War to our situation as much as Christian Appy."</b><br><b>&#x2014;Ken Burns<br></b><br>The critically acclaimed author of <i>Patriots </i>offers profound insights into Vietnam&#x2019;s place in America&#x2019;s self-image</b>. <b><br> </b><br><br>How did the Vietnam War change the way we think of ourselves as a people and a nation?

We thought we were something else.</p><p>&#x2014;Robert Stone, Dog Soldiers (1974)</p><p>&#x201c;I DIDN&#x2019;T KNOW there was a bad war,&#x201d; George Evans recalled. He grew up in Pittsburgh in the 1950s. Starting at age six, before and after school, he helped his father deliver blocks of ice to poor and working-class people who could not afford the shiny new refrigerators advertised in all the magazines. George understood that the American Dream was beyond the grasp of his parents and most of their friends and neighbors. He was a streetwise kid. He knew life was difficult and the future uncertain.</p><p>But there was one thing George trusted completely&#x2014;his nation&#x2019;s military power and the good that it did. With all his heart he believed the United States was on the side of justice and freedom and all our wars were noble. Despite personal hardships, you could always count on Americans to be the good guys, and always victorious. It was simply unimaginable that the United States might betray that faith.</p><p>&#x201c;I was raised in a family and neighborhood of extreme patriots,&#x201d; George explains. &#x201c;My father was the commander of his VFW post and I got to go to the club and hang out with the veterans. I was their little mascot.&#x201d; He especially looked forward to Flag Day, when he would help the World War II vets decorate the graves in a military cemetery. &#x201c;Imagine how beautiful it looked to a kid to see hundreds of graves in a geometric pattern, all with shining bronze plates and flags waving in the wind. You just can&#x2019;t exaggerate the pull of the military on kids from neighborhoods like mine. Everything you&#x2019;d seen and heard your whole life made it feel inevitable and right.&#x201d;</p><p>But George&#x2019;s faith in America&#x2019;s global goodness was forever destroyed in Vietnam, where he served as an air force medic. &#x201c;I realized that the country I was from was not the country I thought it was.&#x201d; One day at the hospital in Cam Ranh Bay he was ordered to clean the bodies of two young Vietnamese boys. They were dead. As he was sponging one of them with soapy water, a Vietnamese woman raced into the room. She must have been the mother, but George wasn&#x2019;t sure. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never forget her face. I can see her still. I remember her hitting me on the chest, grabbing me. Then she was running back and forth between the two bodies, from child to child.&#x201d; George later learned that the boys were hit by an American military truck driver who may have been competing with other drivers over &#x201c;who could hit a kid. They had some disgusting name for it, something like &#x2018;gook hockey.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>With the possible exception of the Civil War, no event in U.S. history has demanded more soul-searching than the war in Vietnam. The false pretexts used to justify our intervention, the indiscriminate brutality of our warfare, the stubborn refusal of elected leaders to withdraw despite public opposition, and the stunning failure to achieve our stated objectives&#x2014;these harrowing realities provoked a profound national identity crisis, an American reckoning. The war made citizens ask fundamental questions: Who are we? What defines us as a nation and a people? What is our role in the world? Just as the Civil War forced Americans to confront the reality of slavery, an institution that stood in glaring contradiction to the nation&#x2019;s avowed ideals of human freedom and equality, the Vietnam War compelled millions of citizens to question the once widely held faith that their country is the greatest force for good in the world, that it always acts to advance democracy and human rights, that it is superior in both its power and its virtue. And just as the Civil War ended slavery without resolving racism and racial injustice, the Vietnam War ended without resolving the conflicting lessons and legacies of America&#x2019;s first defeat.</p><p>The Vietnam War still matters because the crucial questions it raised remain with us today: Should we continue to seek global military superiority? Can we use our power justly? Can we successfully intervene in distant lands to crush insurgencies (or support them), establish order, and promote democracy? What degree of sacrifice will the public bear and who among us should bear it? Is it possible for American citizens and their elected representatives to change our nation&#x2019;s foreign policy or is it permanently controlled by an imperial presidency and an unaccountable military-industrial complex?</p><p>Our answers to those questions are shaped by the experience and memory of the Vietnam War, but in ways that are cloudy and confusing as well as contested. I believe we could make better contributions to our current debates if we had a clearer understanding of that war&#x2019;s impact on our national identity, from its origins after World War II all the way to the present. But this is not a conventional chronological history. There are already many good ones. Nor am I interested in irresolvable speculation about how the war might have turned out differently if only other decisions had been made or alternative strategies pursued. I want instead to explore the ways the war changed our national self-perception. It is such an important and even obvious subject you might assume it has been thoroughly examined and exhausted. After all, there is now a vast literature about various aspects of the Vietnam War&#x2014;so many books we don&#x2019;t even have a precise count and no one could possibly read them all. Surprisingly, however, only a small number have taken on this topic and none have tracked it over a six-decade span. My ambition, therefore, is not just to enrich our understanding of the Vietnam War, but to show how we have wrestled with the myths and realities of our nation&#x2019;s global role from the early days of the Cold War to the wars of the twenty-first century.</p><p>To do so, I have drawn on a great variety of sources&#x2014;everything from movies, songs, memoirs, novels, and advertisements to official documents, polling data, media coverage, Pentagon studies, government propaganda, presidential speeches, and contemporary commentary. And, of course, I have relied on a long list of superb scholars and journalists whose work made this one possible.</p><p>My main argument is that the Vietnam War shattered the central tenet of American national identity&#x2014;the broad faith that the United States is a unique force for good in the world, superior not only in its military and economic power, but in the quality of its government and institutions, the character and morality of its people, and its way of life. A common term for this belief is &#x201c;American exceptionalism.&#x201d; Because that term has been bandied about so much in recent years as a political slogan and a litmus test of patriotism, we need to be reminded that it has deep roots and meaning throughout our history. In many ways the nation was founded on the faith that it was blessed with unrivaled resources, freedoms, and prospects. So deep were those convictions they took on the power of myth&#x2014;they were beyond debate. Dissenting movements throughout our history did little to challenge the faith.</p><p>That&#x2019;s what made the Vietnam War&#x2019;s impact so significant. Never before had such a wide range of Americans come to doubt their nation&#x2019;s superiority; never before had so many questioned its use of military force; never before had so many challenged the assumption that their country had higher moral standards.</p><p>Of course, the faith in American exceptionalism has hardly disappeared. Countless times since the Vietnam War our presidents have invoked it in support of wars and interventions around the world. Although the public has been more reluctant to use military force than its leaders, there is still substantial support for the idea that our power is benign and that America remains a singularly admirable nation. That&#x2019;s why virtually everyone who runs for higher office in the United States pledges allegiance to the creed.</p><p>Yet even many ardent believers understand that the faith is no longer as broad or assured as it was before the Vietnam War. In 2000, for example, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the war&#x2019;s end, Henry Kissinger wrote: &#x201c;One of the most important casualties of the Vietnam tragedy was the tradition of American &#x2018;exceptionalism.&#x2019; The once near-universal faith in the uniqueness of our values&#x2014;and their relevance around the world&#x2014;gave way to intense divisions over the very validity of those values and the lengths we should go to promote and defend them.&#x201d; Kissinger had been almost as responsible as President Richard Nixon for prolonging the Vietnam War an additional six years. When it finally ended in 1975, 58,000 Americans had died, and three million Vietnamese. Yet in 2000 Kissinger chose to mourn the loss of American exceptionalism. For him, there was nothing so terrible about the war to justify any doubt about our nation&#x2019;s superiority.</p><p>Unlike Kissinger, many others believed the war exposed American exceptionalism as a dangerous myth. They did not regret its passing. National aggrandizement had led the United States into an unjust and unwinnable war. In Robert Stone&#x2019;s 1974 novel Dog Soldiers, for example, John Converse is a disillusioned American journalist in Vietnam who persuades an old Marine Corps buddy to smuggle heroin into the United States. As they discuss the deal, with gunfire in the background, Converse says: &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t know who we were till we got here. We thought we were something else.&#x201d; The war, he implies, was a kind of awakening. It enabled Americans to recognize their capacity for bloodlust and evil. His friend Ray Hicks offers a witheringly sardonic comment about the price of that awakening: &#x201c;What a bummer for the gooks,&#x201d; he says. Americans were learning hard truths about themselves and their nation on the backs of a people they dehumanized and killed and whose country they wrecked. It was an expensive education and Vietnam bore by far its greatest cost.</p><p>For many people, major reappraisals came slowly, a testament to their deep trust in American institutions and values. In the 1950s and early 1960s, before the major military escalation in Vietnam and the shocking revelations it brought, Americans had remarkable faith in their elected officials. Until the mid-1960s, roughly three-quarters of Americans told pollsters they trusted the government to do the right thing. Therefore, when public leaders announced that the United States was in Vietnam to save the people of South Vietnam from Communist aggression and to defend freedom and democracy, few challenged the accuracy of the claim or the necessity of the commitment. And when Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy said the struggle in Vietnam was required to prevent Communism from taking over one nation after another like tumbling dominoes until our own shores would be directly imperiled, that seemed not just a reasonable theory, but a frightening possibility. And the broad acceptance of Cold War policies was bolstered by the era&#x2019;s equally broad religiosity. The idea that the United States was engaged in a godly crusade against atheistic Communism was not an extreme position in the 1950s, but part of everyday discourse.</p><p>It was still unimaginable to most Americans that their own nation would wage aggressive war and justify it with unfounded claims, that it would support antidemocratic governments reviled by their own people, and that American troops would be sent to fight in countries where they were widely regarded not as liberators, but as imperialist invaders. Of course, there were cracks in the Cold War consensus even in the 1950s&#x2014;the emergence of a mass struggle for civil rights, new forms of dissenting art, literature, and music, early signs of a growing youth culture, and the critical perspectives of older left-wing activists and intellectuals whose challenges to state and corporate power dated back to the intense political struggles of the 1930s. Even so, it is hard today to recover a full sense of how effectively the dominant Cold War culture blanketed the nation with an uncritical acceptance of America&#x2019;s right and responsibility to intervene overseas.</p><p>But as the Vietnam War continued, year after year, that faith declined dramatically. Alarming evidence mounted that the United States was doing exactly the opposite of what its leaders claimed. Instead of saving South Vietnam, U.S. warfare was destroying it. South Vietnam was not an independent nation, but wholly dependent on American support. The United States did not make progress by amassing huge body counts of enemy killed, but only convinced more Vietnamese that it was a foreign aggressor. Prolonging the war did not preserve American credibility; it only did further damage to the nation&#x2019;s reputation.</p><p>As citizens came to reject their government&#x2019;s claims, many also shed the once commonplace assumption that Americans place a higher value on life than foreign foes. That faith was eviscerated by the vision of U.S. soldiers burning down the homes of Vietnamese peasants and forcing millions off their ancestral land; the incessant U.S. bombing, year after year, with nothing to show for it but further death and destruction; and the indelible images from My Lai, where an American company of infantrymen slaughtered five hundred unarmed, unresisting Vietnamese civilians.</p><p>By 1971, 58 percent of Americans had concluded that the war in Vietnam was not just a mistake, but immoral. More than at any time in our past, broad sections of the public, cutting across lines of class, gender, race, and religion, rejected the claim that American military power was an invincible force for good. Many concluded that the United States was as capable of wrongdoing as any nation or people, if not more so. And by 1973, when the final U.S. troops were withdrawn from Vietnam, only a third of Americans still trusted the government to do what was right.</p><p>Critics of the war were not the only ones whose faith in American exceptionalism was damaged or destroyed. Pro-war hawks were also disillusioned. They agonized over the U.S. failure in Vietnam. Why had the greatest military power in world history been unable or unwilling to prevail against a small, poor, agricultural people? What happened to the America that had rallied so magnificently to defeat Fascism in World War II? Had the protests and divisions of the 1960s forever destroyed our national will and patriotism? And how would the world ever respect us again knowing that we abandoned the Vietnamese government we had so long supported?</p><p>For the political right, defeat in Vietnam was an intense motivator. Conservatives were determined to rebuild everything they thought the war had destroyed&#x2014;American power, pride, prestige, and patriotism. Above all, they wanted to resuscitate a faith in American supremacy. Their restoration project was a key factor in the rightward movement of American culture and politics in the decades after Vietnam. It depended, in part, on efforts to redefine the political and moral meanings of the Vietnam War. Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980 saying Vietnam had been a &#x201c;noble cause&#x201d;&#x2014;a war that should have been fought and could have been won. Only a core of hard-line conservatives agreed with that, but many more voters agreed with Reagan&#x2019;s claim that the country and its military had been badly weakened and unfairly attacked by the protest movements of the 1960s, liberal polit...</p></p><h2>California Mathematics: Concepts, Skills, and Problem Solving, Grade 6</h2><p>Used.

Roosevelt and Joseph V. Stalin</i> (&#x201c;History owes a debt to Susan Butler for the collection and annotation of these exchanges&#x201d;&#x2014;Arthur Schlesinger, Jr).<br><br>Making use of previously classified materials from the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History, and the Archive of the Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation, as well as the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and three hundred hot war messages between Roosevelt and Stalin, Butler tells the story of how the leader of the capitalist world and the leader of the Communist world became more than allies of convenience during World War II. Butler reassess in-depth how the two men became partners, how they shared the same outlook for the postwar world, and how they formed an uneasy but deep friendship, shaping the world&#x2019;s political stage from the war to the decades leading up to and into the new century.<br><i><br>Roosevelt and Stalin</i> tells of the first face-to-face meetings of the two leaders over four days in December 1943 at Tehran, in which the Allies focused on the next phases of the war against the Axis Powers in Europe and Asia; of Stalin&#x2019;s agreement to launch another major offensive on the Eastern Front; and of his agreement to declare war against Japan following the Allied victory over Germany. <br><br>Butler writes of the weeklong meeting at Yalta in February of 1945, two months before Roosevelt&#x2019;s death, where the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany was agreed on and postwar Europe was reorganized, and where Stalin agreed to participate in Roosevelt&#x2019;s vision of the United Nations.<br><br>The book makes clear that Roosevelt worked hard to win Stalin over, pursuing the Russian leader, always holding out the promise that Roosevelt&#x2019;s own ideas were the best bet for the future peace and security of Russia; however, Stalin was not at all sure that Roosevelt&#x2019;s concept of a world organization, even with police powers, would be enough to keep Germany from starting a third world war, but we see how Stalin&#x2019;s view of Roosevelt evolved, how he began to see FDR as the key to a peaceful world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Butler&#x2019;s book is the first to show how FDR pushed Stalin to reinstate religion in the Soviet Union, which he did in 1943; how J. Edgar Hoover derailed the U.S.-planned establishment of an OSS intelligence mission in Moscow and a Soviet counterpart in America before the 1944 election; and that Roosevelt had wanted to involve Stalin in the testing of the atomic bomb at Alamogardo, New Mexico.<br><br>We see how Roosevelt&#x2019;s death deeply affected Stalin. Averell Harriman, American ambassador to the Soviet Union, reported that the Russian premier was &#x201c;more disturbed than I had ever seen him,&#x201d; and said to Harriman, &#x201c;President Roosevelt has died but his cause must live on. We shall support President Truman with all our forces and all our will.&#x201d; And the author explores how Churchill&#x2019;s&#x2014;and Truman&#x2019;s&#x2014;mutual mistrust and provocation of Stalin resulted in the Cold War.<br><br>A fascinating, revelatory portrait of this crucial, world-changing partnership.</p></p><p><p>Susan Butler was a freelance writer whose work regularly appeared in the New York Times.

He was on his way to pay homage at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. There was a holiday air in the city: flags were on display, and banks were closed for the day. As the president&#x2019;s car reached the cemetery and proceeded to the tomb, a twenty-�one-�gun salute, fired from the latest antitank guns, boomed out across the Potomac valley.<br><br>At eleven o&#x2019;clock, the exact hour the armistice had been signed, Roosevelt stood bareheaded between General Edwin &#x201c;Pa&#x201d; Watson, his military aide, and Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, his naval aide, in front of the tomb. The day was chilly and raw, the trees almost bare; there was a cold wind. Over the president&#x2019;s shoulders was the dark navy dress cape he frequently wore on short trips from the White House. An army bugler flanked the group on one side; a soldier holding a big wreath of yellow and russet chrysanthemums stood on the other. An army band struck up &#x201c;The Star-�Spangled Banner,&#x201d; after which there was the customary moment of silence. Admiral Brown then took the wreath and laid it on the tomb for the president. Four ruffles of muffled drums were heard, and the bugler blew taps.<br><br>Following the brief ceremony, the sounds of a second twenty-�one-�gun salute boomed out across the valley as the president&#x2019;s car wound its way out of the cemetery.<br><br>The House of Representatives marked the day with commemorative speeches, most of which voiced the sentiment that ways must be found to make the coming peace more durable than the last. The Senate was not in session.<br><br>Roosevelt was in the tenth year of his presidency, the country almost two years into World War II. As darkness fell and rain started, the president again left the White House by car, but unlike in the morning he slipped out unobtrusively. He was on his way to the marine base at Quantico, Virginia, where the USS Potomac, the sleek white 165-�foot presidential yacht, a Coast Guard cutter to which an upper deck and a cabin had been added, awaited. It would take him on the first leg of the 17,442-�mile trip through submarine-�infested waters to Tehran, Iran, more than halfway around the world. There, for the first time, he would meet Joseph Stalin, the supreme leader of the Soviet Union, the renegade. It would be a momentous occasion for both of them and for the world.<br><br>With Roosevelt was his closest adviser, Harry Hopkins, in charge of the Lend-�Lease program providing the massive aid flowing to the Soviet Union; his chief of staff, Admiral William Leahy; his personal physician, Vice Admiral Dr. Ross McIntire; Admiral Brown; General Watson; and his physical therapist, Lieutenant Commander George Fox. The president&#x2019;s car arrived at a dark, seemingly deserted dock far away from intrusive eyes, where the Potomac awaited. Aboard the Potomac all was in readiness.<br><br>Exactly six minutes after the presidential party stepped onto the ship, it headed down the Potomac River bound for Cherry Point, Virginia, in the Chesapeake Bay, sixty-�three miles distant, where it anchored for the night.<br><br>A little after 9:00 the next morning the Potomac approached the USS Iowa, anchored out in the bay in deeper water. It drew up alongside, and in the very light, cool morning air Roosevelt was placed in a sort of bosun&#x2019;s chair rigged from the rear sundeck of the Potomac and swung aboard the Iowa&#x2019;s main deck just abreast of number three turret. When the transfer of the rest of the party was completed, the Potomac vanished into the distance, ordered to cruise out of sight and away from its well-�known home berth for the next week, to create the impression, in case any journalist noticed the president&#x2019;s absence, that he was off on another private pleasure cruise aboard what some called the Floating White House because of the large amount of time he spent on it.<br><br>Roosevelt had always loved the sea. As a young boy at Campobello Island in Canada, where he summered, he had learned to sail his father&#x2019;s sailboat the Half Moon, a forty-�six-�foot cutter, taking it out every chance he got and handling it with ease. After he contracted polio at thirty-�nine and lost the use of his legs, he had invested in a houseboat that he kept in Florida waters and lived on for months at a time.<br><br>Now he was looking forward to the voyage of the Iowa, the navy&#x2019;s newest, largest, fastest battleship. It had been specially fitted out for him: an elevator installed, ramps built over the coamings and deck obstructions to accommodate his wheelchair. As in all places where FDR lived, in the bathroom there was a tub with metal railings that FDR could grasp to raise himself up, a toilet bowl exactly the height of his wheelchair, and a mirror low enough so he could shave sitting down. His favorite leather-�upholstered reclining chair was also in his quarters.<br><br>Half an hour after he was swung aboard, the big ship was under way. Waiting to greet FDR were all the top brass of the U.S. Armed Forces: General George C. Marshall, chief of staff of the U.S. Army; H. H. &#x201c;Hap&#x201d; Arnold, commanding general of the U.S. Army Air Forces; General Brehon B. Somervell, chief of Army Service Forces; Admiral Ernest J. King, commander in chief of the U.S. Fleet; and Admiral William Leahy, the president&#x2019;s chief of staff; plus four other generals, three more admirals, and about fifty staff officers of subordinate rank. At Roosevelt&#x2019;s request, no honors were rendered as he came aboard, and because of wartime restrictions his flag was not flown. Also aboard were the eight Secret Service men who always guarded the president.<br><br>So began Roosevelt&#x2019;s trip to meet Joseph Stalin, a meeting he had been trying to arrange for two years and had gone to extraordinary lengths to bring about.<br><br>He and Churchill had chosen Casablanca as a meeting place the previous January because they thought there was a good chance Stalin would agree to meet them there. &#x201c;We are trying to get Stalin to come,&#x201d; Roosevelt had confided to Mike Reilly, supervising Secret Service agent at the White House, as he briefed him on the trip, firmly adding, &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t go any further than Casablanca to meet him.&#x201d; But in the face of Stalin&#x2019;s objections to every location he suggested, the president&#x2019;s resolve had crumbled: now he was going thousands of miles farther.<br><br>The Tehran meeting had been planned to promote Roosevelt&#x2019;s dearest objective, the establishment of an international organization, a more effective version of the League of Nations, of which every nation would be a member. Such an organization, he believed, was the best, indeed the only, way to maintain a peaceful world. It would supply a forum where any member nation could state its grievance and where all nations could converse. In certain situations it would also have the authority to act. Roosevelt planned that there would be four superpowers&#x2014;�the United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and China&#x2014;�that would act as the world&#x2019;s four policemen. These four, with greater powers than other nations, would enforce order after the war was won.<br><br>Stalin was critical to the president&#x2019;s plan. The war had changed nations in unforeseen ways. Postwar, only two superpowers would remain: America and Russia. Without the membership and support of the Soviet Union, Roosevelt realized, there would be no international organization. With it, the United Nations, as Roosevelt had named the proposed organization, would start out as the first true government of the world.<br><br>Roosevelt expected to be challenged at his first meeting with the Soviet ruler, and he fully intended to be equal to the task. He planned to impress Stalin with his intelligence, his steadiness of character, and above all his power. In that way he would make the world&#x2019;s most paranoid ruler feel secure. He had to make Stalin comfortable with his ideas of how the world should be run when the war was over: Russia had to take part.<br><br>FDR read everything he could about Stalin, who was a Georgian, a bit more than two years older than he, born on the southern rim of Russia to an impoverished, alcoholic father and a mother who, recognizing his intelligence, had persuaded the clergy to educate him in church schools. Stalin had become a rebel, changing his name from Djugashvili to Stalin (steel), and caught the eye of Lenin, whose successor he became. He was, like FDR, physically disabled: two toes on his left foot were fused, giving him a slight rolling gait, and he held and used his left arm awkwardly, the result of being knocked down by a horse and carriage when he was a child.<br><br>FDR received conflicting descriptions. He queried the few people he knew who had met him. One, Anna Louise Strong, a founder of the Moscow News, a weekly newspaper for Americans, remembered that FDR was particularly, almost obsessively, interested in Stalin&#x2019;s personality. (Contrary to many people&#x2019;s experience, she had found Stalin &#x201c;the easiest person to talk to I ever met.&#x201d;) FDR knew of his violent background, that he was ruthless, that he imprisoned or killed anyone who stood in his way. In 1930 he had compared Stalin to Mussolini. In 1940, speaking to a group of students gathered at the White House, he had famously said that Stalin&#x2019;s dictatorship was &#x201c;as absolute as any other dictatorship in the world,&#x201d; that he was guilty of &#x201c;the indiscriminate killings of thousands of innocent victims.&#x201d; He was under no illusion as to the nature of the Soviet ruler, nor had he any thought of meddling in the Soviet Union&#x2019;s internal affairs. He needed Stalin, and, FDR expected, Stalin needed him as much or even more. As Roosevelt said to his personal physician, Vice Admiral Ross McIntire, aboard the Iowa, &#x201c;I bank on his realism. He must be tired of sitting on bayonets.&#x201d;<br><br>He had arranged an Egyptian prelude: a four-�day round of conferences in Cairo with Winston Churchill and Chiang Kai-�shek and, he hoped, Vyacheslav Molotov, the Soviet commissar of foreign affairs, the second most powerful man in the Soviet Union, together with their respective military staffs. After that, he, Churchill, and Molotov would make the short hop by plane to Iran to meet with Stalin. The Cairo Conference was to be the place where the four countries, in concert, would begin to formulate strategic plans&#x2014;�&#x201c;begin their work,&#x201d; as Roosevelt presented it to Stalin. The meeting would underline Roosevelt&#x2019;s insistence that China be accepted as the fourth great power in the world, even though its power was latent and the country was both in the midst of a civil war and fighting a Japanese invasion. However, when Stalin found out the Chinese leader would be in Cairo, he canceled Molotov&#x2019;s trip, as well as that of the Russian military representative, because he was afraid that if Japan learned that Molotov had met with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-�shek, the Japanese might close the port of Vladivostok, so crucial to the Soviet war effort, or worse, unleash the Kwantung army on the Manchurian border. By the time Roosevelt learned of the cancellation, he was already on the high seas.<br><br>It was a setback for Roosevelt, but not crucial, because Cairo was important mainly from a public relations standpoint. Roosevelt was the most publicity conscious of presidents. The Russian absence would not take away from the positive publicity that would ensue from Roosevelt&#x2019;s public embrace of Chiang Kai-�shek in such an exotic place.<br><br>He was haunted by memories of the League of Nations that had failed so miserably. President Wilson had had the dream and the will but neither the public relations skills nor the political savvy needed to make it happen. As assistant secretary of the navy, Roosevelt had been in Paris winding down the U.S. naval presence in France while the Versailles conference was taking place. He watched as Wilson was forced to agree to the vengeful clauses insisted on by his allies: their price to join the League of Nations. He had sailed for the United States on the George Washington with Wilson. At lunch in Wilson&#x2019;s cabin, he listened as the president loftily said, &#x201c;The United States must go in or it would break the heart of the world.&#x201d; Roosevelt was personally persuaded of the crucial importance of the league, but he knew that Wilson was going home to inform the U.S. Senate of what membership in the league entailed and that key Republican senators, excluded from the peace process by Wilson, indeed entirely ignored, were lying in wait for him.<br><br>Wilson was attacked in the Senate and took his battle to the country. As Wilson futilely battled on, Roosevelt watched his health break down.<br><br>The dream of a world government stayed with Roosevelt. He and the State Department started roughing out the plans for a world organization in 1939, as Hitler began his assault on Europe. FDR would leave no stone unturned in his quest to succeed. What he took away&#x2014;�what he had learned firsthand from Wilson&#x2019;s failure&#x2014;�was that it wasn&#x2019;t enough to have laudable goals, nor sufficient for a president to proclaim them to an enthusiastic, listening planet; after all, Wilson&#x2019;s Fourteen Points had electrified the world. It was necessary to win the backing of his allies and of the U.S. Senate, and it had to be done before the war was over.<br><br>FDR kept a portrait of Wilson over the mantelpiece in the Cabinet Room, which he used as a venue to work over speeches with his speechwriters. He would look up at it as he sat working on a speech, remembered the speechwriter, FDR biographer, and friend Robert E. Sherwood: &#x201c;The tragedy of Wilson was always somewhere within the rim of his consciousness. Roosevelt could never forget Wilson&#x2019;s mistakes.&#x201d;<br><br>Roosevelt identified in advance the key groups he had to win over, then built consensus within each group by pointing out the practical advantages that would accrue by following his lead. Before any group was ready to make policy, Roosevelt was there, leading the way.<br><br>He had taken to heart the advice given him by A. Lawrence Lowell, president of Harvard, from whom he had taken Government 1 his freshman year at college. The occasion was the Harvard Club annual dinner in New York in January 1933, honoring Roosevelt, when Roo�sevelt, as president-�elect, was putting together his cabinet and top staff. Lowell, the keynote speaker, turning to face Roosevelt directly, had said that the most important principle for the chief executive was that he must always take and hold the initiative in his dealings with Congress, with his cabinet, and generally with the public. Lowell affirmed that if Roosevelt always applied this principle, he would succeed. Roosevelt, according to his Harvard classmate Louis Wehle, who had worked with him on the Crimson, was following Lowell&#x2019;s remarks &#x201c;with absorbed attention and . . . at their end he was deeply thoughtful.&#x201d;</p><p>Excerpted from Roosevelt and Stalin by Susan Butler.

The beginning is familiar: an inner city Los Angeles kid named East is working as a low level hired gun assigned to watch a drug den. When things go bad, he is sent out of town with his wilder half-brother and two older gang members to perform a hit. Their target is a man who is hiding out in Wisconsin. What comes next is a novel that is part road trip, part fish-out-of-water, part violent crime thriller, part coming-of-age, and something else altogether. The sense of empathy that the author, Bill Beverly, creates in the reader is as illuminating as it is unexpected. These are characters who we care for, even if we never expected to, and as East finds himself at a personal crossroads, we are right there with him. I tore through this novel and was genuinely disappointed that it had to end. <em>--Chris Schluep</em>BILL BEVERLY grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and studied at Oberlin College and the University of Florida.

Four wagons, in good repair, stood to one side, oxen grazing nearby, while two carriages, once pretty things, were barely standing on their high wheels. Tired women went about the chore of preparing supper while the men looked after the animals. A group of children was playing within sight of the adults.<br><br>"I can't tell you how glad I am to be rid of some of this heat. It's the sea I miss." Mrs. Watson stood, putting a hand on the small of her back to ease her stomach and the child that would soon be born. "Where's Linnet, Miranda?" she asked the woman across the fire from her.<br><br>"She's playing with the children again." The smaller woman's voice had a clear, English accent, so different from her companion's slurred words.<br><br>"Oh, I see her now." Mrs. Watson shielded her eyes from the glare of the setting sun. "If a body didn't know better, you wouldn't be able to tell which was the children and which was Linnet." She watched the girl, holding hands in a circle, no taller than the half-grown children for all her twenty years, a loose dress covering the young curves of her body, the same curves that had sent Mrs. Watson's oldest boy to the Tyler wagon so many times. "You know, Miranda, you and Amos ought to talk to Linnet. It's high time she had some young'uns of her own, 'stead of takin' on everybody else's."<br><br>Miranda Tyler smiled. "You're welcome to try, but Linnet has her own mind. Besides, to be honest, I'm not so sure young men are ready to take on the responsibility of my daughter."<br><br>Mrs. Watson looked away and gave an embarrassed little laugh. "I'm afraid you're right. Not that there's anything wrong with Linnet, she's certainly pretty enough, but it's just the way she looks at a man, something about the way she stares at him and the way she always seems to be able to take care of herself. Mind if I sit a spell? My back hurts more every minute."<br><br>"Certainly, Ellen. Amos set a stool out for me."<br><br>The heavy woman sat, knees apart, as she tried to balance her huge stomach. "Now where was I?" She either didn't see or pretended not to see Miranda's frown. "Oh yes, I was talking about Linnet, the way she unnerves men. I did try to talk to her once, tried to explain how men like to feel they're somethin' special. Now look over yonder to Prudie James."<br><br>Miranda did as she was told before returning her attention to the pot of beans.<br><br>"Now there isn't a time of the day when Prudie isn't surrounded by young men," Ellen continued. "She's not near as much to look at as your Linnet, but she always has the boys. Remember last week when Prudie was stung by a wasp? Four boys ran to help her."<br><br>Miranda Tyler looked across the clearing to her daughter, her lips curving in a fond smile. She had her own memories, such as the time the little Parker boy had left the camp alone. Linnet had been the one who found him and had risked her own life to wedge herself under those loose rocks and bring the terrified boy to safety. Mrs. Watson could have all her Prudies she wanted.<br><br>"Of course, I'm not sayin' anything against Linnet, she's shore been a big help to me, it's just that I...well, I want to see her happy, with a man of her own."<br><br>"I'm grateful for your concern, Ellen, but I'm sure Linnet will find a husband someday and I'm sure he'll be to her liking. Would you excuse me, please?"<br><br>The only warning they had was a dog's yip, cut off in the middle, but even that wasn't heard since the children were laughing in glee as they waited excitedly for the thimble to be secretly placed in their waiting hands.<br><br>The Indian raiders had long ago learned the benefit of surprise, attacking when the tired men and women were most relaxed, least vigilant. The men on guard had been easy to kill, their throats slashed in one clean, silent stroke. All that remained were the women, a few young adults, and the children. The children were what was of most interest to them, and two young braves were sent to tie and secure them.<br><br>Linnet, like the others, was paralyzed with shock. Her head turned sharply at a muffled cry, and she saw Prudie James fall to a heap on the ground. People began running then, trying hopelessly to escape the Indian men who seemed to be everywhere.<br><br>Linnet saw her mother take a step forward. Linnet put out her arms and began to run. If she could catch her mother, hold her, everything would be all right. "Mother!" she screamed.<br><br>Something hit her foot, and she slammed forward, the hard ground knocking the breath from her. Dazed, she tried to recover herself, feeling a moment of panic when her breath did not return right away. She blinked her eyes, seeing everything spin. As she turned her head, she tasted blood in her mouth from where her teeth had sunk into her lip when she'd fallen. Her mother lay quietly on the ground, near the fire, close to Mrs. Watson. They might have been napping, so ordinary did they seem, except the ground around them was a growing pool of a thick, red substance.<br><br>"Linnet! Linnet!" Screams came from behind her as a hand roughly pulled her to her feet and pushed her toward the children. Little Ulysses Johnson ran to her, his arms wrapped about her legs, his tears wetting her skirt and his little body shaking horribly. He was pulled from her by one of the Indians. When the child fell, the man jerked the boy's arm so that he cried out in pain.<br><br>"No!" Linnet ran to the boy, knelt before him and smoothed the dirt from his face. "I think they mean to take us with them. You'll be brave, Uly? We'll all be together, whatever happens. I don't think they'll hurt us if we obey them. Do you understand, Uly?"<br><br>"Yes," came his jerky reply. "My Ma..."<br><br>"I know..." One of the Indians pushed her, pulling her hands behind her back, tying them tightly with the cutting, rawhide rope. She tried not to look at the carnage to her right, to the body of her mother, or to think of her father who had been on guard duty. She faced her eyes ahead to the six children in front of her.<br><br>It had been only minutes, yet their lives were forever changed. Patsy Gallagher fell, dragging Uly with her, and screamed when the Indian pulled her by her ties to her feet, the thin leather cutting her wrists. Ulysses began to cry again, and all the children stared at the fires the Indians had started and the bloody messes that had been their parents.<br><br>Linnet began to sing. Quietly at first, but with a slow, steady persistence that first one child and then another began to join: "Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee."<br><br>They began walking, stumbling, falling often, as they marched slowly into the wilderness, tied together in a single, awkward line.<br><br>Linnet held Ulysses in her arms, the child's limp body as much unconscious as asleep. They'd been traveling for three days with little rest and less food. The two younger children looked as if they couldn't last much longer, and Linnet had persuaded one of the Indians, the leader, to allow her to carry the boy on her back. She moved her toes now, aware of the blisters, the many cuts. She was hungry, but she'd given half her cornmeal to Ulysses, and still he had whimpered for more. She stroked his forehead, aware that he was becoming feverish.<br><br>There were five Indians, sullen men, who demanded what they wanted and always got their demands. When Linnet had slowed her step because of the added weight of the heavy five-year-old on her back, they had prodded her with sharp sticks, forcing her to keep pace. Now she was too weary to sleep, her body hurting in too many places.<br><br>One of the Indians turned toward her and she hastily closed her eyes. Several times she had seen them pointing at her and talking, and she knew they discussed her.<br><br>It wasn't light yet when the seven captives were pulled to their feet and made to begin another day's journey. Near sunset, the Indians led them to a stream, waist deep, and pulled them into it.<br><br>"I'm scared, Linnet. I don't like the water," Uly said.<br><br>"I'll carry him." Linnet gestured to the man at the end of the line. He cut the connecting leather, and Ulysses climbed onto her back.<br><br>The other children were already on the far side when Linnet slipped and fell into the water. Instantly, one of the men cut the line that connected her to the others -- they would not risk losing all their prisoners if one should chance to drown. Linnet had a difficult time pulling the hysterical, fighting Ulysses to shore, and when she did, she lay back on the ground panting from her exertions.<br><br>"Linnet! What are they saying?" Patsy Gallagher demanded.<br><br>Linnet looked up to see two of the men pointing at her and gesturing wildly. He called another man, the leader, and she saw the anger on this man's face. Still dazed by her struggle in the water, she took a long time to realize that they pointed at her chest. The wet garment clung to her, emphasizing her full breasts. She crossed her hands to cover herself.<br><br>"Linnet!" Patsy screamed as one of the Indians advanced on her angrily.<br><br>She moved her arms quickly to cover her face from the first blow, but could not shield herself from the bard kicks to her ribs. She doubled in pain as more blows fell.<br><br>The Indians spewed angry words at her, and one hand turned her to her back, her bruised, maybe broken, ribs causing her to catch her breath sharply. The man tore her dress away to the waist, exposing her to him. What be saw seemed to make him even more angry. He doubled his fist, but Linnet never saw it land across her jaw.<br><br>"Linnet, wake up!"<br><br>She stirred slightly, wondering where she was.<br><br>"Linnet, they let me take care of you. Here, sit up and put this on. It's Johnnie's shirt."<br><br>"Patsy?" she whispered.<br><br>"Oh, Linnet, you look awful! Your face is all swollen and..." The girl sniffed and pulled her friend to a sitting position as she shoved her arms into the coarse linsey-woolsey shirt. "Linnet, talk to me. Are you all right?"<br><br>"I think so. They let you come? I thought they would leave me. Why were they so angry?"<br><br>"Well, me and Johnnie figure they thought you was a kid and when they found out you wasn't..."<br><br>"Oh, but why have they let you come to me?" "I don't know, but if it wasn't for you, we all know we couldn't have made it. Maybe the Indians know that, too. Oh ' Linnet, I'm so scared." The girl threw her arms around Linnet's neck and she had to clench her teeth to keep her pain from showing.<br><br>"I'm scared, too," Linnet whispered through her teeth.<br><br>"You! You're never scared. Johnnie says you're the bravest person in the world."<br><br>She smiled at the girl, although it hurt her to do so. "I may look brave, but I'm all apple jelly inside."<br><br>"Me, too."<br><br>Patsy helped Linnet back to the Indians' camp, the woman no larger than the twelve-year-old girl. All the children welcomed her with half-smiles, the first time they had even tried to overcome their terror.<br><br>Early the next morning, they reached the more permanent camp of the Indians. Women, dirty, ragged, ran to greet their men and run hands over the children. The Indian leader pushed Linnet toward a group of women, pointing and gesturing from his chest to hers.<br><br>One of the women yelled and tore the shirt open, striking her on the breasts. Linnet bent forward and covered herself with her arms, and the women laughed. She looked up to see the children being led away, their cries for help making her try to go to them, but the women stopped her, laughing, pinching her. One of them pulled her braids.<br><br>The Indian man spoke again, and the women took their hands from her, grumbling. One pushed her forward until Linnet realized she was to crawl into a crude grass-and-stick shelter. There wasn't room to stand in the shelter, just room for two people to sleep. The woman followed her, holding a pottery bowl in her hands.<br><br>The contents of the bowl smelled horribly of rancid grease, and the Indian woman began to smear the paste all over Linnet's face, and the upper part of her body, working it into her hair, She sat still, trying not to cry out or give way to her tears when the woman's rough hands pressed on a particularly bruised area.<br><br>She was left alone then, alone to listen to the noises outside, the frantic yells of the men as they celebrated their successful raid.<br><br>"Here, drink this." A strong arm supported Linnet and a metal cup was pressed to her lips. "Not so fast or you'll choke."<br><br>She blinked several times, not aware that she had fallen asleep. The man's wide shoulders seemed to fill the little shelter. The flickering light from a fire outside caught the ivory gleam of a necklace tight around his throat, his body barely clad. He gently leaned back against a supporting pole and took her wrist, studying her hands before rubbing salve into the cuts.<br><br>"I can see why they thought you were a child," he said in a deep low voice.<br><br>"You speak English," Linnet said in her quiet accent.<br><br>He cocked one eyebrow at her. "Not the same sort as you, but I reckon it'll pass for English."<br><br>"I saw you. I thought you were an Indian, but you're not. I think your eyes are blue, aren't they?"<br><br>He looked at her in surprise, wondering at her apparent calm.<br><br>"Where are the children? Why are we here? They...killed the others."<br><br>He looked away from her for a moment, not wanting to see the grief in her eyes, yet amazed that she could even think of someone besides herself. "This is a group of renegades, a mixture of outcasts from several tribes. They capture children and sell them to other tribes to replace lost sons and daughters. They thought you were one of the children and weren't too happy when they found you weren't." His eyes went involuntarily to her breasts. Crazy Bear had had a lot to say about her womanliness.<br><br>"What...what do they plan to do with us now?"<br><br>He watched her carefully, his blue eyes intense.

Set in Britain just after WW II, the main sleuth here is not actually George Felse but his 13-year-old son Dominic. He and his best friend, Pussy Hart, are playing when Dom finds the body of Helmut Schauffler, an ex-P.O.W. who had stayed on after the war in the Comerford area. An autopsy indicates that Schauffler's skull was fractured by blows that were "precise, neat and of murderous intention." Helmut, a loathsome blend of cruelty, cowardice and anti-Semitism, is hardly mourned, but his death so rends the village's social fabric that solving the case is imperative. In his first murder investigation, George has difficulty viewing his neighbors as suspects, although the area does have its share of demobilized veterans, i.e., trained killers. Even more distressing to George and his wife Bunty is the proprietary--and potentially fatal--interest that Dom takes in the case. By giving the youth a finely balanced blend of doggedness, good luck, ingenuity and foolhardiness, Peters sets out a very effective mystery while expressing, through the gradual unfolding of the character of Helmut,her own serious skepticism that aperson--or a country--can change his--or its--spots. In 1991, Mysterious reissued Flight of the Witch , a Felse mystery written in 1964. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.In postwar England, the village of Comerford--home to Police Sergeant George Felse--has its share of returned heros: Quiet teacher Chad Wedeerburn; decorated paratrooper Jim Tigg, now sheepherding on Chris Collins's farm; and Charles Blunden, who fought his way across Italy, now back to his father Selwyn's substantial land holdings. There are also a few POWs in Comerford- -helping where needed. Helmut Schauffler is one of them--hard- working, outwardly meek, but Nazi to the core. He's finally been placed with a group of coal-mining workers but continues his secret verbal torture of Gerd, the stoic Jewish refugee wife of farmer Chris. When Sergeant Felse's clever young son Dominic finds Schauffler's body in a shallow brook, the suspects are many, but the case is still unresolved when a second murder stimulates Dominic to a burgeoning flood of logic and courage beyond his years, forcing the solution to a puzzle deep-rooted in the past. The first of the Sergeant Felse series to appear in the US (it was published in England in 1951), joining the author's Brother Cadfael stories. The leisurely, introspective style so well suited to the life and times of a 12th-century monk seems excessively slow and wordy here, but there are rewards for the patient reader. Others may find it a bit of a slog. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Bunny Yeager has long been credited for capturing Bettie Page&#x2019;s true nature&#x2014;her flirtatious and playfully erotic side&#x2014;in classic pinup images that continue to influence photography and fashion today. This collection, culled from Yeager&#x2019;s extensive archive, features her most iconic shots of the legendary Bettie as well as never-before-seen images, including many nudes, which by all reports is how Bettie was most comfortable. Yeager was a young pinup photographer in 1955 when she hit the jackpot with her shot of Bettie scantily clad in a Santa hat, which sold instantly to the fledgling Playboy magazine. It was the beginning of a long collaboration between the two women, and Yeager&#x2019;s photographs of Bettie have now been featured on more magazine covers than those of her contemporary, Marilyn Monroe. This glamorous book gathers more than two hundred lens-fogging photographs of Bettie embodying the naughty girl-next-door eroticism of pin-up culture, with such playful chapters as: "Jungle Land," "Nutty Cheesecake," "Sweet and Savage," and "She Devil." A fun and sexy volume, this is the most comprehensive book on Bettie Page to date.</p><p>Petra Mason is a cultural historian and creative director who regularly contributes to various publications and partners with Books &amp; Books Press.

Indeed, you&#x2019;ll notice that one of the many things that sets Page apart is her expert grasp of how to accentuate her "holy shit!" figure. She was often lifting, reaching, stretching, twisting, and rejoicing. Maybe it's this obvious confidence and unabashed joy &#x2014; all despite the many challenges Page faced in her impoverished, abusive childhood &#x2014; that makes Bettie so appealing to women. In fact, women make up the majority of Page&#x2019;s fan base, according to filmmaker Mark Mori, director of the documentary <i>Bettie Page Reveals All.</i> <b>She inspires females of all sizes and shapes</b> to embrace and express who they are, as they are.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Refinery29</i><br><br>"Last year, Miami&#x2019;s Bunny Yeager Studio opened, and the photographer was working on a collection of never-before-seen Page shots, called&nbsp;<i>Bettie Page: Queen of Curves</i>,&nbsp;which will be published in September to coincide with the 60th anniversary of their first photo session..<i>." -The Daily Beast</i><br><br>&#x201c;<b>You Have To Own</b>...<i>Queen Of Curves</i> is the application of Bunny&#x2019;s philosophy and talent put to the test.

Chris and his wife currently live in Keansburg, New Jersey, with their 180-gallon planted aquarium and 75-gallon reef aquarium.Grade 9 Up&#x2014;Marine aquaria are not for the faint of heart, needing careful setups, informed denizen selection, and proper maintenance far beyond the care of simple guppies in a jam jar. Here, Brightwell focuses on a unique format-the nano- (or mini) reef, weighing in at tanks of 15 gallons or under. Beginning with the necessity for consistent water quality, he follows through with the proper physical components (tanks, water monitors, filters, lighting, etc.) and the role of complete routine maintenance procedures before getting down to the nitty-gritty of stocking. His advice on selecting motile and sessile invertebrates and on choosing fish is thoughtful, as is his chapter on setting up (which includes several effective templates). Larded with attractive color photos, from the eye-catching cover through the informative text, the book includes Internet resources, useful organizations and publications, and an extensive index. Less detailed perhaps than Vincent B. Hargeaves's large-format <i>The Complete Book of the Marine Aquarium</i> (Thunder Bay, 2002), this volume is more informative than David E. Boruchowitz's colorful <i>Starting Your Marine Aquarium</i> (T.F.H., 1998) and somewhat more complex than George Blasiola's <i>The Saltwater Aquarium Handbook</i> (Barron's, 2000). Brightwell has created an up-to-date how-to for competent aquarists with limited space.&#x2014;<i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Anthony Burgess&#39; infamous nightmare vision of youth culture in revolt, fifteen-year-old Alex and his friends set out on a diabolical orgy of robbery, rape, torture and murder. Alex is jailed for his teenage delinquency and the State tries to reform him - but at what cost? Burgess writes of social prophecy and free will in this black comedy.</p><p>Anthony Burgess was born in Manchester in 1917. He studied English at Manchester University and joined the army in 1940 where he spent six years in the Education Corps. After demobilization, he worked first as a college lecturer in Speech and Drama and then as a grammar-school master before becoming an education officer in the Colonial Service, stationed in Malay and Borneo. In 1959 Burgess was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour and decided to become a full-time writer. Despite being given less than a year to live, Burgess went on to write at least a book a year - including A Clockwork Orange (1962), M/F (1971), Man of Nazareth (1979), Earthly Powers (1980) and The Kingdom of the Wicked (1985) - and hundreds of book reviews right up until his death. He was also a prolific composer and produced many full-scale works for orchestra and other media during his lifetime. Anthony Burgess died in 1993.Anthony Burgess's 1963 novel was published with a glossary of the dystopian language used by Alex, the brutal teenage narrator. The quality of Tom Hollander's performance, however, renders such help unnecessary. Hollander's vocal suggestiveness, grasp of tone, and overall emotional resonance with the novel give listeners amazing clarity (especially if, like this reviewer, they've previously read the book relying on the glossary). You listen to Alex's adventures, amazed at the clarity Hollander gives to such a verbally ambitious work. This recording also includes the last chapter of the novel (not published in the first American edition), Burgess's later introduction to the book, and, from the Caedmon archives, Burgess himself reading excerpts.

They chatted, exchanged ideas, offered suggestions, and ended up solving some of their difficult baking problems. Slowly a concept took shape. Suppose groups of like-minded bakers were to meet to exchange ideas and solve baking problems?</p><p>At the first meeting of The Baker's Dozen, forty people showed up with forty lemon meringue pies. The topic of the meeting was weeping and shrinking meringues and how to prevent them from happening. (The solution: Heat the egg whites and sugar while beating to avoid weeping; use more egg whites to solve the problem of shrinking.)</p><p>The word spread quickly, and The Baker's Dozen has grown to more than ten times the original number -- there are now more than four hundred members in the Bay Area. The groups continue to have two simple goals: Share what you know about baking and learn from one another.</p>Now you can share the collective experiences and favorite recipes of The Baker's Dozen in <em>The Baker's Dozen Cookbook,</em> with recipes selected and tested by some of the most respected and most accomplished bakers in the business.<p>Lindsey Shere, co-founder and pastry chef of Chez Panisse, shares the secrets of tarts. Authors Carol Field and Fran Gage and baker Peter Reinhart offer their collective wisdom on yeast breads and flatbreads. John Phillip Carroll teaches about easy quick breads, coffee cakes, and muffins. Renowned author and baker Flo Braker and her team share their years of cake-baking experience. Carolyn Weil and her group offer the ultimate advice and techniques for pies and piecrusts. Robert Morocco and Julia Cookenboo divulge their trade secrets of making foolproof cookies equal to those of any quality bakeshop.</p><p><em>The Baker's Dozen Cookbook</em> goes far beyond recipes. You'll benefit from what these bakers learned on their field trips. You'll learn tricks such as using dental floss to cut neat slices of creamy cheesecake. You'll learn the differences between a pastry bag and a parchment cone; between a p�te bris�e, a "broken dough," and a p�te sabl�e, a "sandy dough"; between butter and shortening in determining the flakiness of a crust; and so much more.</p><p>So whether you simply want to become a better baker yourself or to form a Baker's Dozen group with others, all you need is <em>The Baker's Dozen Cookbook.</em> It puts four hundred of America's best bakers and everything they know right by your side.</p>For baking tips, recipes, and information on starting your own Baker's Dozen, visit www.bakersdozen.org</p><p>Founded by cookbook author Marion Cunningham and professional baker Amy Pressman, the Baker's Dozen, a Bay Area group, helps its members bake better, sharing knowledge and solving members' baking problems. Edited by Rick Rodgers, <i>The Baker's Dozen Cookbook</i>, the group's first work, includes 135 enticing recipes, from Sour Cream Pound Cake and Almond and Chocolate Sandwich Cookies to breads and other nonsweet baked goods. The book's great appeal, however, lies in its lucid instructive material. New and veteran bakers alike will find this collection a true learning tool, which provides basic tutorials and more-advanced explorations into the art of baking.<p> The recipes come with a pedigree. Readers can thus enjoy baking-book expert Flo Braker's Triple Chocolate Cake and Peanut Butter and Strawberry Jam Cake, "Italian baker" Carol Field's Italian Whole Wheat Bread, and Chez Panisse pastry chef Lindsey Shere's Warm Pear Tart and Simple Nectarine Gallete. Other outstanding recipes include Julia Cookenboo's Pistachio-Golden Raisin Biscotti, Fran Gage's Spicy Cornmeal Crackers, and Rochelle Huppin-Fleck's Blood Orange Chiffon Pie with Chocolate Crumb Crust. In addition to insightful notes that accompany every recipe, the book offers definitive ingredient and equipment glossaries (chocolate is particularly well treated here), a detailed cake-basics section (batter-mixing for all cake types as well as other techniques are explored in depth), and color photos that depict the mouthwatering sweets in all their glory. The group has done its work well--this is one of the best baking books to appear in recent years. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><p> Flo Braker, author of the award-winning <em>Sweet Miniatures: The Art of Making Bite-Size Desserts</em> (Chronicle Books, 2000) and <em>The Simple Art of Perfect Baking,</em> has been teaching baking techniques and her sweet miniatures across the country for more than twenty-five years.

His representations of gas stations, storefronts, cafeterias and hotel rooms embody the solitude of travel and adult life in the America of the thirties, forties and fifties. Because of the familiarity of his subject matter, Hopper has been pigeon-holed both historically, as an American realist, and thematically, as an artist of alienation.<br>Mark Strand, recent poet laureate and writer of many books of award-winning poetry, approaches Hopper's work with a fresh eye, exploring the aesthetic principles behind the paintings. Strand, whose poems move through a terrain similar to that portrayed by Hopper, possesses a unique and powerful understanding of what makes the paintings so moving and memorable. He writes with his distinctive clarity and grace, examining twenty-three of Hopper's most important works. He cites aesthetic reasons for Hopper's continuing ability to deeply move people in an America that has grown considerably more complex both politically and socially since mid-century.</p><p>"Mark Strand looks more deeply into Hopper's pictures than anyone else has before."<br>--Adam Gopnik<br><br>"Strand takes the poet's entrance into the silent world of Hopper with a gift of words that allows painter and poet to become partners in opening the windows of the imagination."<br>--Wayne Theibaud<br><br>"Strand's perceptions are intuitive and visceral.

A number-one bestseller in Israel, <i>Spinoza and Other Heretics</i> is made up of two volumes--The Marrano of Reason and The Adventures of Immanence. Yirmiyahu Yovel shows how Spinoza grounded a philosophical revolution in a radically new principle--the philosophy of immanence, or the idea that this world is all there is--and how he thereby anticipated secularization, the Enlightenment, the disintegration of ghetto life, and the rise of natural science and the liberal-democratic state.</p><br><p> The Marrano of Reason:</p><br><p> The Marrano of Reason finds the origins of the idea of immanence in the culture of Spinoza's Marrano ancestors, Jews in Spain and Portugal who had been forcibly converted to Christianity. Yovel uses their fascinating story to show how the crypto-Jewish life they maintained in the face of the Inquisition mixed Judaism and Christianity in ways that undermined both religions and led to rational skepticism and secularism. He identifies Marrano patterns that recur in Spinoza in a secularized context: a "this-worldly" disposition, a split religious identity, an opposition between inner and outer life, a quest for salvation outside official doctrines, and a gift for dual language and equivocation. This same background explains the drama of the young Spinoza's excommunication from the Jewish community in his native Amsterdam. Convention portrays the Amsterdam Jews as narrow-minded and fanatical, but in Yovel's vivid account they emerge as highly civilized former Marranos with cosmopolitan leanings, struggling to renew their Jewish identity and to build a "new Jerusalem" in the Netherlands.</p></p><p>This book identifies the origins of the idea if immanence in the undercurrents of the Marrano culture, the group from which Spinoza sprang. Marranos were former Jews in Spain and Portugal who had been forcibly converted to Christianity.</p><h2>Librarian on the Roof!

I lay in the brush and trembled, my heart pounding, my throat aching for water, the ground shaking under me as powerful hooves pounded in advance of a thousand human feet. My spear was tipped with an obsidian point, but it would fare poorly against the charge of a warhorse wearing the thick leather guard called a Cort�s shield.<br>&nbsp;<br>We set up the ambush in the rocky, mountainous terrain of Nochistian, waiting for the Spaniards and their traitorous indio allies to fall into the trap.

The great warhorses had terrified the Emperor Montezuma and his Eagle and Jaguar Knights, the finest warriors in all the One World. The warriors believed the tall, powerful, four-legged creatures were gods; what else could these denizens from Another World be but spirits of the Earth and Sky? They ran like the wind, crushed any before them under their heavy hooves, and made the warriors on their backs a hundredfold more deadly than those on foot.<br>&nbsp;<br>As a rider came closer, I realized that it was an indio on horseback.<br>&nbsp;<br>�Ayya! I had never seen an indio on horseflesh before. Horses were powerful weapons in war, jealously guarded by the Spanish, who forbade indios from owning or riding them. Tenamaxti, our leader, told us that the Spanish had mounted the caciques, the chiefs, of their indio allies on horseback so their foot soldiers could better follow them in battle. "The traitors who fight for the invaders call the horses big dogs," Tenamaxti told us. "They rub the sweat of the horse onto themselves to get some of the beast's magic."<br>&nbsp;<br>Tenamaxti knows the invaders well, having lived in the Aztec capital the invaders now call M�jico City. He is known to the Spanish by the name they gave him, Juan Brit�nico.<br>&nbsp;<br>Horses were not the only thing forbidden to indios by our new masters. When our leaders and gods failed us, the invaders captured more than the gold of our kings; they enslaved us with a terrible servitude: the encomienda, vast grants of power and privilege, fiefdoms given to Spaniards. We called these white men on their grand horses gachupines, wearers of spurs, sharp spurs they used to rowel our backs bloody as they stole the food from our mouths.<br>&nbsp;<br>Their mighty king, the one they call the Catholic Majesty, presses his seal on a piece of paper, and thousands of indios in a region are enslaved to a Spaniard who comes to the One World with one purpose: to grow rich on our labor. To this wearer of spurs we must give as tribute a share of all that we grow on our land or produce with our hands. When he wants a noble palace built for his comfort, we stop tilling our land and carry the stones and cut the timbers needed. We must tend his cattle and his horses but not touch the meat of the farm animals or mount the horses. �Ayya! When he demands, we must lend him our wives and our daughters.<br>&nbsp;<br>Is it any wonder that when Tenamaxti gave the call, we gathered as in the days of the great Aztec kings, bringing spears to kill these invaders who enslave us?<br>&nbsp;<br>As I watched the dark figures in the fog, one who rode taller in the saddle than any other appeared. �Yya ayya! It could be no other than the Red Giant himself, Pedro de Alvarado, the butcher of Tenochtitl�n, a fiend with hair and beard the color of fire. Known for his rashness and cruelty, Alvarado was infamous second only to the Conqueror himself for his brutal atrocities.<br>&nbsp;<br>He first earned fame--and evil reputation--when Cort�s was forced to leave Tenochtitl�n, the Aztec capital, and rush to Veracruz to defeat a Spaniard who had landed with a force of men, intending to deprive Cort�s of his command. He left Alvarado behind in Tenochtitl�n with eighty Spanish conquistadors and four hundred indio allies to hold the great city. Alvarado also held Montezuma captive. Paralyzed by his belief that Cort�s had fulfilled the prophecy that the god Quetzalc�atl would return to claim the empire, Montezuma was easy prey.<br>&nbsp;<br>While awaiting Cort�s's return, Alvarado heard a rumor that the leaders of the city planned to take the remaining Spanish captive during a festival. A man of unlimited expediency and utter cruelty, Alvarado attacked first: As the festival began, his men opened fire on the people celebrating in the marketplace. But it was not Aztec warriors he blasted with cannons and had put to death with swords, spears, and harquebuses . . . a few notables and warriors were killed, but a thousand women and children were slaughtered in the orgy of bloodletting.<br>&nbsp;<br>Cort�s defeated the Spanish commander who intended to usurp his authority and returned to the capital to find Alvarado and his men holed up in Montezuma's palace and besieged by Aztecs angered by the massacre of innocents. Not able to defend their position, Cort�s led his men out of the city, and it was in the retreat that Alvarado, the Red Giant, gained his greatest fame.<br>&nbsp;<br>On the evening that came to be called La Noche Triste, the Night of Sorrows, Alvarado achieved an immortal feat. The Spanish had retreated onto the causeways that led over the lake to the city. During heavy fighting, faced with a break in the causeway too wide for any man to leap, Alvarado, weighed down with heavy armor, turned his back on the Aztec warriors attacking him, ran to the edge of the causeway, stabbed his spear into the back of a drowning man who had already fallen into the water, and vaulted over to the other side.<br>&nbsp;<br>Many times I had heard his amazing tale, and now I realized he was the powerful foe in the dark vision of my own death that had haunted me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I could no longer lie upon the ground and tremble like a frightened child. I had to face the Red Giant. I rose, clutching my spear. In the tradition of a Jaguar Knight, I gave the cry of that fierce jungle beast to add the strength of the jaguar's god to my own.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even through the din of battle that had erupted around us, Alvarado heard my cry. He swung in the saddle and turned to look at me. He spurred his great stallion, raised his sword and gave the cry of his war saint. "For Santiago!"<br>&nbsp;<br>I watched myself die.<br>&nbsp;<br>The vision of my own bloodied, lifeless body that had long haunted my sleep flashed as the warhorse charged, carrying on its back the most famous warrior in the One World. My wooden spear, even with its razor-sharp obsidian point, would not penetrate either the horse's thick padded shield or the armor of the Spaniard. The only way to defeat the invader was to bring him down by making his horse fall.<br>&nbsp;<br>I threw my body at the horse's knees, using my spear against the ground much as Alvarado had used a spear in his famous leap.<br>&nbsp;<br>My body broke the stride of the warhorse as if the beast had run into a huge rock. It began to topple onto me. I saw it, slowly falling . . . like a big tree, gathering speed as it came down on me. I saw Alvarado's frantic, startled look as he, too, came down, toppled from his mount, flying headfirst to the rocky ground. I felt my bones breaking, my chest caving, no breath coming, as the huge warhorse crushed me--<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2006 by Eugene Winick, Executor, Estate of Gary Jennings</p><h2>The Exeter Book</h2><p>&#34;&#34;The Exeter Book&#39;, the largest and probably the best known of the four great miscellanies of Anglo-Saxon poetry, receives its name from the fact that it is preserved in the library of Exeter Cathedral, having been given to the cathedral by Leofric, the fist bishop of Exeter, who died in 1072.&#34; This contains copies of 35 manuscripts making up part of the Anglo-Saxon poetic records.</p><p></p><h2>Training People: How to Bring Out the Best in Your Human</h2><p>For centuries, dogs have known that they, not humans, run the show.

Blaize lived for many years in Sarasota, Florida.<p>CHAPTER 1 It was early April, about nine o&#x2019;clock in the morning, when I first met Laura Halston. Well, I didn&#x2019;t exactly meet her. It was more that I almost ran her down. <br>I was easing my Bronco around a curve on the single narrow lane in Fish Hawk Lagoon, a heavily wooded area on the north end of Siesta Key. Driving there is like going through a tunnel cut in a mountain. Towering oaks meet overhead to block out the sky, and one side of .gainvillea, sea grape, potato vine, and practically every known variety of palm and pine. On the other side, a .body can see rich runners sweat. <br>As I rounded a curve, a woman in running gear leaped into the street from the wooded side and raced .ond faster I would have hit her. I came to a jolting stop .ror in her eyes. At the curb, she swooped in a graceful arc and picked up a dark brown cat with a long lashing tail. Holding the cat firmly in her arms, she pulled iPod wires from her ears and turned toward me in fury. <br>&#x201c;Idiot! Bitch! You nearly hit me!&#x201d; <br>I don&#x2019;t take kindly to being called an idiot or a bitch, especially by a woman who looked like she had an IQ smaller than her size zero waist. She was about my age, which is thirty-three, and I pegged her as either a runway model or a rich man&#x2019;s trifle. Like the cat, she was an exquisite creature, but her beauty seemed accidental, an unplanned coming together of parts that shouldn&#x2019;t have fit but did. Almost albino pale, she was fine-boned and slim, with tousled white-blond hair cut high at the back of her neck and flopping over eyebrows too thick, too dark, too crude. Her eyes were like jade stones set too far apart, her nose was a fraction too long and thin, her chin too pointed. She should not have been beautiful, but she was. She also had the snottiness of a woman accustomed to getting anything she wanted because she was beautiful. <br>With what I thought was remarkable restraint, I said, &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s a hot tip. The best way to avoid being hit by a car is to avoid jumping in front of one.&#x201d; <br>Twin patches of pink outrage gave her pale face some color. &#x201c;How could I know you were there? I couldn&#x2019;t hear you! You&#x2019;re sneaking around in a... in a stealth .vate streets!&#x201d; <br>.buds. I was pretty sure it was Pink, so my estimation of her went up a few notches. <br>I said, &#x201c;Maybe if you weren&#x2019;t listening to music, you could hear better. That&#x2019;s Pink&#x2019;s latest cut, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; <br>She looked surprised. Her mouth got ready to say something mean and then changed its mind. <br>I said, &#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;m sorry I startled you. I&#x2019;m Dixie .borhood.&#x201d; <br>Her face relaxed a bit, but she didn&#x2019;t seem the type to apologize for being rude. <br>I said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a gorgeous cat. Havana Brown?&#x201d; <br>It was the magic phrase. Pet owners melt like bubble gum on a hot sidewalk when you compliment their babies. <br>She said, &#x201c;His name is Leo. An old boyfriend gave him to me, only he called him Cohiba, for the cigars. Dumb, huh? What cat&#x2019;s gonna come when you say Here, Cohiba? I changed it right away. He hates being cooped up in the house. Well, so do I, to tell the truth. Anyway, when I opened the door to go running, he ran out with me. I was afraid I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to catch him, so I guess I should thank you for scaring him so he stopped.&#x201d; <br>.pened so fast it was like watching a cartoon. When she wasn&#x2019;t angry, her eyes sparkled with energy and she spoke in a breathless rush, as if she had so much to say that she was afraid she&#x2019;d never get it all said. <br>..duced the cat and sort of exonerated me because I&#x2019;d made him stop so she could catch him, there wasn&#x2019;t much else to talk about. <br>I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you caught him,&#x201d; and edged on past her. <br>She raised her hand in a hesitant half wave, and in the rearview mirror I could see her watching when I turned into my client&#x2019;s driveway. <br>Like I said, I&#x2019;m Dixie Hemingway, no relation to youknow-who. I&#x2019;m a pet sitter on Siesta Key, which, like Casey Key, Bird Key, Lido Key, and Longboat Key, forms a narrow barrier between the Gulf of Mexico and Sarasota, Florida. Officially, Siesta Key is part of the city of Sarasota, but when you get right down to it, we&#x2019;re not part of anything but ourselves. Our function is to absorb the fury of storms so they weaken a little bit before they .rect view of spectacular sunsets, and annual hikes in storm insurance rates that keep our blood circulating nicely. <br>Before I became a pet sitter, I was a deputy with the Sarasota County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department, but I left with the department&#x2019;s blessing a little over three years ago. I..stroyed my mind. When I was able to function again, I became a professional pet sitter. It was a good move. The pay is good, the animals I take care of are mostly sweet and lovable, and I don&#x2019;t have to spend a lot of time interacting with destructive people. <br>I get up every morning at four o&#x2019;clock, brush my teeth, rubber-band my hair into a ponytail, pull on a pair of khaki cargo shorts and a sleeveless T, lace up my Keds, and begin my rounds. I mostly take care of .sional rabbit or ferret or bird. No snakes. While I firmly believe that every snake has the right to live well and prosper, I get swimmy-headed around creatures whose diet consists of things swallowed still kicking and squealing. <br>On the key, you either live on the Gulf side or the Sarasota Bay side. Fish Hawk Lagoon is on the bay side at the north end. My clients there were Hal and Gillis Richards, their three-year-old son Jeffrey, and Jeffrey&#x2019;s .zure disorder, and Hal and Gillis were leaving that morning to take him to All Children&#x2019;s Hospital in St. Petersburg for brain surgery. Mazie would have to stay at home. For the last couple of days, I had come there .tomed to me, and Pete Madeira, an octogenarian who .ing to move into the house with Mazie to keep her .ment when child and dog realized they were going to be separated. <br>Their house was like most houses on Siesta Key&#x2014; pseudo-Mediterranean/Mexican stucco with barrel-tile roof, lots of curves and arches. In this case the stucco was the color of terra-cotta, and the barrel-tile roof was dark blue. It was surrounded with the same lush green foliage and flowering shrubs that most yards on the key have, the kind of extravagant natural beauty that those of us living here year-round take for granted. <br>When I rang the doorbell, Hal Richards opened the door. Hal probably wasn&#x2019;t much older than I, but strain and worry had put lines in his face, and thinning hair and a layer of fat softening a former athletic build made him seem older than he was. <br>.frey breakfast, so come on in the kitchen.&#x201d; <br>I followed him into a large sunny room with a glass wall offering a view of a dock behind the house where a small pleasure boat rocked. Siesta Key has over fifty miles of waterways, so boats are common. From Hal Richards&#x2019;s pallor, though, I doubted that he went out in his very often. Gillis, a softly pretty dark-haired woman in a scoop-neck T-shirt and an ankle-length linen skirt, stood at the sink stirring something in a cereal bowl. Like Hal, Gillis wore the stunned look of people whose world has shrunk to the small arc of here and now. <br>Jeffrey sat in a child&#x2019;s booster chair at a round table..ing, and a new purple bruise on his upper arm. Dark shadows lay like soot under his drug-dulled eyes. Mazie, a golden retriever, sat close beside the boy&#x2019;s chair. The dog&#x2019;s eyes were bright and healthy, watching the boy with close attention. <br>Adults with seizure disorders frequently have seizure-alert dogs who sense when a seizure is coming and signal the person, then do whatever is necessary to protect them from harming themselves during the attack. Children as young as Jeffrey can&#x2019;t be made responsible for that kind of warning. Instead, they have seizure-assistance dogs, who may or may not sense impending seizures, but stay close by the child&#x2019;s side at all times. <br>Gillis smiled at me and put a bowl of something white and lumpy in front of Jeffrey. <br>Gillis said, &#x201c;Jeffrey, say hello to Miss Hemingway.&#x201d; <br>The kid spooned up a blob of whatever his mother had given him and grinned shyly. <br>I said, &#x201c;Is that oatmeal you&#x2019;re eating?&#x201d; <br>Gillis said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s groats, actually, with some banana mixed in.&#x201d; <br>I managed to keep my upper lip from lifting, but the word groats sounded too much like gross to me. Besides, what the heck are groats, anyway? <br>Gillis smiled. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s whole oats, healthier than oatmeal. Jeffrey likes it. Don&#x2019;t you, Jeffrey?&#x201d; <br>The kid nodded, but he didn&#x2019;t seem excited about it. Actually, he didn&#x2019;t look as if much of anything excited him. I didn&#x2019;t know a lot about seizure disorders, but I knew the erased look that people get when they&#x2019;re on heavy medication, and Jeffrey had it. <br>Knowing that Mazie was a service dog currently on duty, I didn&#x2019;t speak to her or touch her. But I sat down at the table so she could smell me and feel my energy. She gave me a quick glance, but her job was to be exquisitely alert to Jeffrey and to any change in him, even something as slight as a change in his body odor that would signal an impending seizure. Hal and Gillis went silent, knowing what I was doing and not wanting to interfere. <br>After a few minutes, I stood up. &#x201c;Hal, maybe you and I should talk in the living room for a minute.&#x201d; <br>Hal said, &#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d; <br>In the living room, I took an easy chair and Hal sat on the sofa. I got out my client notebook and prepared to take any last-minute instructions or information. <br>Sometimes people are surprised to learn that pet sitting is a profession like any other. I approach it the same way I approached being a deputy. I was always aware that lives could depend on my being a...</p></p><h2>The Illustrated Olive Farm: A Newly Written, Illustrated Companion to Her Bestselling Trilogy</h2><p><p>A sumptuously illustrated companion to the bestselling <i>Olive Farm</i> trilogy.

She lives in Brooklyn.<br>Toddler-PreS-An accordion-style board book featuring one of the most well-known Spanish songs for children. In this classic nursery song of the Spanish-speaking world, little chicks go, "!Pio! !pio! !pio!" when they are hungry and when they are cold; mother hen finds food for them and keeps them warm. Snuggled up under her wings, they sleep until the next day. In a clever use of the format-one side is the Spanish version, the other the English adaptation-neither language takes precedence over the other. In a nod to its origin, the English adaptation still has the chicks squealing in Spanish. The simple, brightly colored cartoon-style illustrations, boldly outlined in black, stand out against a white background. With every page turn, there are flaps to open and even a wheel that will send mother hen's legs spinning off to find food, making it a fully immersive and interactive reading experience. This sturdy volume comes in a case, all the better to hold those accordion pages with. With so many books translating English songs into Spanish, it is a rare treat to have one with an original Spanish song, especially when it is so engagingly done. VERDICT Little ones and their grown-ups will love singing and reading this book together.

Reprint.</p><p>Richard Overy is a professor of history at the University of Exeter. A leading expert in World War II history, he has written more than twenty books, including <em>Why the Allies Won</em>, and <em>The Twilight Years</em>.This companion to a BBC-TV series is an eminently readable revision of the causes of World War II. Expanding upon earlier revisionist studies such as A.J.P. Taylor's Origins of the Second World War (LJ 4/15/62; Atheneum, 1983. pap.), Overy presents the 1920s and 1930s as perceived by the major powers at the time without the benefit of hindsight. There are no "pure knights" here preparing for the "good war," only paranoid politicians haunted by the effects of World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the Great Depression weaving alliances motivated by an all-pervading social Darwinism. Even Poland is not the "innocent victim" of hindsight; among other things, the idea for resettling Jews in Madagascar was originally Polish. One could fault Overy for playing down Stalin's more sinister machinations, but suspicious as the Western powers were of Bolshevism, they did see Russia as a deterrent to German expansion.

But to the Western mind, the concept of striking acupuncture points to disrupt the internal energy, or chi, seems like hocus-pocus. Thus, many serious martial artists dismiss the ancient art of dim-mak (also known as kyusho jitsu), which is literally translated as &#34;death touch,&#34; as nothing more than fiction. However, if one can accept the idea that a dim-mak point is an avenue for attacking the nervous system, then it becomes easier to understand how striking specific points or groups of points can devastate the organs and the cardiovascular system. In this book, Dr. Michael Kelly, an osteopathic physician and experienced dim-mak practitioner, explains dim-mak&#39;s effects based on medical science. In layman&#39;s terms, Dr. Kelly reveals the physiological basis for what is clearly a very real and dangerous method of fighting. In the process of unraveling the mystery of this legendary art, Dr. Kelly makes the true genius of its founders brutally, and painfully, apparent.</p><p>As an osteopathic physician and a former state police officer, Michael Kelly has had multiple opportunities to test his martial art skills and his knowledge of dim-mak. Dr. Kelly has trained in Okinawan shorin-ryu karate for more than 15 years and is a second-degree black belt. He has been investigating the effects of dim-mak on the body as well as the pressure point attacks hidden within the traditional forms for the past 10 years and has published numerous articles on the medical aspects of dim-mak.</p><h2>6 Killer Bodies (Body Movers, Book 6)</h2><p><br><br>Carlotta Wren's world is crumbling beneath her well-shod feet.

They were heading north to Buckhead so Jack could drop her off at Peter Ashford's home. She was still reeling from watching her good friend Cooper Craft be arrested as The Charmed Killer, a monster who had murdered nine women, leaving a charm in the mouths of his victims as his signature. There was only one problem: Coop wasn't a serial killer.<br><br>"I know it isn't my fault." Carlotta dabbed at her wet eyes with the handkerchief Jack had given her. "Because it's <em>your </em>fault, Jack."<br><br>He frowned. "Mine? How do you figure that?"<br><br>"You tipped off the GBI that Coop was coming to see me at Neiman's." Carlotta worked at the store as a sales associate, although lately not up to her potential, considering all <em>the</em>...<em>diversions </em>of her life. Missing fugitive parents. A delinquent brother dodging loan sharks. Serving as an on-again, off-again body mover for the county morgue. "Insinuating" herself into police investigations (according to Jack's partner, Detective Maria Marquez).<br><br>Jack's mouth tightened. "It was better for Coop to be taken into custody sooner rather than later, and in a public place. At least no one was hurt."<br><br>"Jack, you can't possibly believe that Coop committed those horrific crimes."<br><br>He slammed on the brake to keep from rear-ending the car in front of him. "Damn traffic. Where the hell are all these people going?"<br><br>The way Jack deflected her question made her wonder if he thought the GBI had arrested the wrong man. "Jack, answer me."<br><br>His jaw hardened. "It doesn't matter what I believe. I'm not on the case, remember? But trust me, the GBI wouldn't have made an arrest without evidence."<br><br>"What kind of evidence?"<br><br>"I don't have specifics."<br><br>"DNA?" she prodded. "The Chief Medical Examiner told me that the state crime lab was supposed to return DNA evidence any day."<br><br>Jack frowned. "Why would Bruce Abrams be talking to you about the case?"<br><br>"Because he knows Michael and I are... connected." Michael Lane, her former coworker, was on the run after committing some pretty heinous acts himself, including trying to kill Carlotta and, after escaping from a hospital mental ward, stalking her. Until Coop's arrest, Michael had been the primary suspect for The Charmed Killer.<br><br>And Michael was still out there somewhere.<br><br>"Plus," she continued, "I played the sympathy card by telling Bruce my father's name had popped up on a list of potential suspects, thanks to your crackerjack profiler, Detective Marquez." She gave Jack a wry smile. "I'm sure she's behind Coop being fingered as The Charmed Killer."<br><br>"Regardless of the outcome, Maria is just doing her job."<br><br>"Do you know, she actually warned me about the men I let into my life? I thought she was talking about you."<br><br>He gave a rueful laugh. "Not bad advice, considering who you're living with."<br><br>"You were happy when I took Peter up on his offer to stay with him until things settle down."<br><br>"I wouldn't use the word 'happy.' I thought you'd be safe with him. But that was before Ashford bought you that stupid tricycle."<br><br>"It was a scooter, Jack. And it was a thoughtful gesture considering I didn't have transportation. Now I'm back in the same spot. I don't suppose you've found the person who planted the explosive under my Monte Carlo?"<br><br>He frowned. "No."<br><br>"Do you still think it was Michael?"<br><br>"Maybe."<br><br>"Who else could it have been?"<br><br>Jack shifted in his seat. "Coop."<br><br>Carlotta's eyes went wide. "Coop? Jack, that's crazy. Coop would never do something like that. Why would he want to hurt <em>me?"</em><br><br>"When your car blew up in the mall parking lot, you told me the only places it had been parked earlier that day was in your garage at the townhouse and at Coop's place when you allegedly paid him a&#x2014;" Jack took his hands off the wheel to draw quotation marks in the air "&#x2014;<em>visit. </em>I can't ignore the fact that Coop had a window of opportunity to plant the device."<br><br>"When I allegedly paid Coop a <em>visit?" </em>Carlotta shook her head. "Jack, if you want to know if I slept with Coop, or with Peter for that matter, why don't you just ask me?"<br><br>"Because, as you so often remind me, it's none of my business." Then he nodded to her lap. "What's that you're holding?"<br><br>She glanced down at the mangled piece of paper, feeling sick all over again. Just before his arrest, Coop had brought her the results of the drug test she'd asked him to conduct on a sample of Wesley's hair. The report stated that her brother tested positive for opiate/Oxycodone, confirming her worst fears. When she'd confronted Wesley about stolen refills of a painkiller and a single tablet of generic OxyContin she'd found on his bathroom floor, he'd told her he'd only taken the drugs temporarily to alleviate the pain he'd experienced from when one of his loan sharks, The Carver, had cut part of his name into Wes's arm.<br><br>But the drug test indicated a more pervasive problem... didn't it? Coop had said over the phone that he wanted to explain the test results to her in person. But before he'd gotten the chance, the GBI had descended and arrested him.<br><br>"It's nothing," she murmured, pushing the paper into her purse. If Wesley was caught taking drugs, his probation would be revoked. All this time, she'd been worried about keeping her brother out of jail, and now, inconceivably, Coop was in lockup. "What's going to happen to Coop?"<br><br>Jack sighed. "He'll be arraigned within a few days."<br><br>"Do you think he'll get bail?"<br><br>"That depends on how good his attorney is, the mood of the judge, and the D.A."<br><br>"Kelvin Lucas?"<br><br>"Right. Since this is the biggest case Fulton County has seen in a while and since one of Lucas's A.DA.'s was murdered, I'm sure he'll handle this case himself."<br><br>She touched her throbbing forehead. "I can't believe this is happening. The idea of Coop being The Charmed Killer is ludicrous."<br><br>Jack clenched his jaw. "Right now, jail is the best place for him to get sobered up and dried out."<br><br>The vision of Coop in a cold, empty cell made her lungs squeeze. He must be feeling dazed and utterly confused. And so alone.<br><br>Jack leaned on the car horn, which was ridiculous considering traffic was at a standstill. "This is bullshit." He reached under the seat and pulled out a siren to set on the dashboard, then switched on the blue light. Begrudgingly, the cars ahead of him eased over to the shoulder to allow him to pass.<br><br>"Are you taking advantage of your position as a law enforcement officer to get around traffic?"<br><br>"You bet your sweet ass I am."<br><br>He pulled ahead, slowed at a red light, then proceeded through when the coast was clear.<br><br>"You're only making it worse for everyone else."<br><br>"Yeah, well, I'm not feeling too generous today."<br><br>Carlotta observed Jack under her lashes. His rugged features and big body were rarely at ease, but a muscle worked in his jaw, and his grip on the steering wheel was more fierce than necessary. Despite the fact that he'd given Coop up to the GBI, Jack, too, was disturbed about the arrest. But was he disturbed because he'd been duped by someone he considered a friend of sorts, or because he believed Coop was innocent?<br><br>But if Jack thought Coop was innocent, why would he give him up? Because he couldn't resist being part of an investigation he'd been dismissed from?<br><br>She knew the detective well enough to know that he wouldn't tell her what was going on in that thick head of his, not if he thought she might go off on her own tangent. She'd have to finesse information out of him.<br><br>"Coop's fall from grace a few years ago is going to hurt him, isn't it?"<br><br>Jack nodded. "He was drunk when he stopped at the scene of an accident and declared a woman dead when she wasn't. Frankly, Coop was lucky he was only stripped of his title as Coroner and had his license to practice medicine suspended. The woman barely survived. If she'd died because of Coop's negligence, he would've been looking at serious time. It doesn't take a psychiatrist to see how something like that could mess with a person's head."<br><br>"But he seemed to be dealing with everything okay," Carlotta said. "I didn't know him when it happened, but Coop seemed at peace with working for his uncle at the funeral home, and moving bodies for the morgue."<br><br>Jack shrugged. "Things change."<br><br>"Not without a reason," she insisted.<br><br>"Everyone has a breaking point," Jack said. "It doesn't have to be a major incident."<br><br>She was tempted to let Jack in on what her brother, Wesley, had told her about following Coop to a neurologist's office, and their concern that Coop was sick. But their suspicions were mere conjecture, and Jack had already betrayed her confidence by informing the GBI when she'd called to let him know that Coop, who had been missing for a day, was on his way to see her at Neiman's. She wouldn't be so forthcoming with information the next time.<br><br>Jack took a call on his phone and from the one-sided conversation, she gathered he was talking to his partner, Maria, who needed a ride somewhere.<br><br>"I'll be there as soon as I can," he said, and Carlotta thought she detected a note of intimacy in his voice.<br><br>The GBI had kept Maria on The Charmed Killer case, but had removed Jack, partly because of his association with Carlotta, who had been indirectly connected to some of the victims&#x2014;either as a body mover on the crime scene, or a passing acquaintance. And the last body had been a speed bump for her scooter. She hated that Jack had to maintain his distance from the investigation just because she'd been implicated in the crimes. Now that an arrest in the case had been made, she assumed Jack and his gorgeous partner would be reunited.<br><br>Not that she cared if Jack and Marvelous Maria were sleeping together. Okay, maybe she cared a <em>little. </em>Carlotta and Jack had rolled around a few times, but Jack was his own man. And she was supposed to be giving her relationship with Peter a fair chance. She and Jack had agreed to stop falling into bed with each other, yet their lives still intersected enough to keep the temptation alive.<br><br>Jack Terry managed to push every emotional button she had&#x2014;Carlotta alternately hated and desired him, loathed and admired him. Right now, she desperately wanted him to tell her that everything was going to be okay, but she was terrified to ask.<br><br>Instead she nursed the ache in her chest and watched out the car window as the houses became increasingly posh until Jack slowed at the entrance of Martinique Estates. He could've pulled up and allowed her to punch in Peter's access code, but Jack preferred to flash his badge at the guard. The long black gates opened and he drove the familiar route through the manicured neighborhood to Peter's palatial home.<br><br>When Jack pulled the sedan into the circular driveway in front of the brick house, Carlotta's stomach clenched at the thought of going inside. Peter wasn't a big fan of Coop's primarily because the man had shown a romantic interest in Carlotta. No doubt Peter would feel vindicated that the good doctor had been so publicly exposed.<br><br>Peter opened the door and waved.<br><br>Jack grunted.<br><br>Carlotta didn't want to get out of the sedan, but she didn't have a choice. Wesley hadn't finished installing a security system in the townhouse, and it wasn't as if Jack had offered her a place to stay. She supposed she could get a hotel room, but that seemed silly considering Peter had offered her the run of his mansion. Especially since her budget didn't allow for extended hotel stays.<br><br>She couldn't explain it, but she felt as if she lived in two worlds&#x2014;in one world was Peter and his home in the suburbs that offered her shelter from the other world of Wesley's problems, Jack's issues and Coop's crises. Peter's world should be more attractive, but it left her feeling isolated.<br><br>"Looks like Ashford's waiting for you," Jack said.<br><br>"The GBI will be in touch. I'm sure they'll want to question you again."<br><br>"I'm not giving them any ammunition against Coop," she said.<br><br>His expression hardened. "Do yourself a favor, Carlotta, and tell the truth. Coop can fend for himself."<br><br>She frowned. "I guess he'll have to fend for himself since his friends have turned on him."<br><br>Jack didn't say anything, just stared ahead.<br><br>She wondered again if Jack was simply toeing the company line when it came to fingering Coop as a mass murderer. Carlotta opened the car door, then looked back. "Jack, aren't you forgetting something?"<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"My red panties? The ones you stole and said you'd keep until The Charmed Killer was behind bars."<br><br>He was quiet for the longest time, studying her. Then the smallest of smiles curved one corner of his mouth. "If it's all the same to you, darlin', I think I'll hold on to those panties for a while."<br><br>She exhaled. "No problem."<br><br>Carlotta climbed out of the sedan and walked toward Peter's house, her heart lighter. In a roundabout way, Jack had just told her that he, too, didn't believe Coop was The Charmed Killer.<br><br>Today, that was enough for her.<br><br>Tomorrow, she had her work cut out for her. If The Charmed Killer&#x2014;whether it was Michael Lane or someone else&#x2014;had involved her in order to frame Coop for the murders, the criminal had messed with the wrong shopgirl.<br><br>T hanks, guys," Wesley said, waving from the stoop of the townhouse at the motley crew of loan shark staffers who had helped him install a security system. Mouse, his collections partner now that he was working undercover in The Carver's organization, had surprised him by offering up the group of "security experts" to expedite the job.<br><br>He went back inside and surveyed the damage. The walls were badly pocked and scarred where wires and sensors had been installed. A wireless system would've been less invasive, but he knew how easily those systems could be hacked into.

The book contains nine stories populated by at least one American Indian (usually of Alexie's Spokane heritage, and mostly living in Seattle), but "little" is a bit of a misnomer; the book addresses human (not necessarily Indian), rituals, ceremony, love, loss, insecurity over life choices, and personal sacrifices. A lot of intense basketball is played, too.<p> When Alexie is at his best, his stories function at a profoundly sad level, where broken down characters are broken down even more, but are fierce-willed enough to attempt Phoenix-like transitions. Unfortunately, the weakest stories appear first, where characters and situations seem far too contrived or forced, the dialogue wooden, and questions or exclamatory sentences appear annoyingly in bunches. In the last half of the book, a married couple, once intensely in love but now lost in life's routines, deal with infidelity ("Do You Know Where I Am?"); a bright basketball prospect attempts a comeback--twenty years after giving up the game ("Whatever Happened to Frank Snake Church?"); and a transient Indian finds his grandmother's regalia in a pawn shop and seeks to quickly raise the lofty purchase price ("What You Pawn I Will Redeem"). Brilliant turns of phrase abound, such as ceremonies being "pitiful cries to a disinterested God," or when a gym rat plays against "Basketball-Democrats who came to the court alone and ran with anybody and Basketball-Republicans who traveled in groups of five and only ran with each other." <i>Ten Little Indians</i> is an uneven collection, but contains some significant, memorable stories. <i>--Michael Ferch</i></p>Sherman Alexie is the author of Reservation Blues, Indian Killer, The Toughest Indian in the World, and Flight. He wrote and directed The Business of Fancy-dancing and also wrote the award-winning screenplay for Smoke Signals, a film based on his short-story collection The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven. He has been nominated for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and has won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction and the American Book Award.</p><h2>Valley of the Dolls</h2><p>The exploits and excesses of three pill-popping showbiz heroines: Anne, the smalltown girl supposedly modelled on Grace Kelly, who captivates a millionaire but falls for an English cad; Jennifer, the beautiful Marilyn Monroe clone who possesses everything - except immortality; and Neely, the ruthless Judy Garlandesque understudy-turned-superstar. As friends - and enemies - they learn the hard way that fame, fortune, beauty and stardom don&#39;t always equal happiness.Jacqueline Susann&#39;s sensational novel staked her claim as a pop pioneer, perfectly crystallized the decadence of the 1960s - and ushered in a whole new genre of mass-market fiction.</p><p>Sex and drugs and shlock and more--Jacqueline Susann&#39;s addictively entertaining trash classic about three showbiz girls clawing their way to the top and hitting bottom in New York City has it all. Though it&#39;s inspired by Susann&#39;s experience as a mid-century Broadway starlet who came heartbreakingly close to making it, but did not, and despite its reputation as THE roman � clef of the go-go 1960s, the novel turned out to be weirdly predictive of 1990s post-punk, post-feminist, post &#34;riot grrrl&#34; culture. Jackie Susann may not be a writer for the ages, but--alas!--she&#39;s still a writer for our times.Jacqueline Susann left her hometown of Philadelphia at eighteen and moved to New York where she acted extensively and won the Best Dressed Woman in Television award four times. But it was the success of her three blockbuster novels- <i>Valley of the Dolls</i>, <i>The Love Machine and Once Is Not Enough</i>-that transformed her into the Pucci-clad media superstar we remember today. Jacqueline Susann was married to producer Irving Mansfield.

It has been exciting, at times a little alarming but without doubt one of the most thrilling experiences of my life. Taking a non-fiction book and turning it into a drama series is a creative process like no other that I have been involved in. However, let me start at the beginning.</p><p>When my then editor at Simon &amp; Schuster, Mike Jones, asked me in November 2009 whether I thought the Women&#x2019;s Institute had done anything interesting in the Second World War I agreed to go and find out. Given that I have written a whole book on the subject, you will not be surprised to know that the answer to his question was emphatically yes. The most surprising thing I discovered about the WI in my first weeks of research was that it was a pacifist organisation. That was not a fashionable thing to be in the late 1930s, but it proved in some ways to be the making of them during the Second World War. They could not be swallowed up into war work so they had to define their own rules and stick to them. As we shall see, this is exactly what they did, devoting themselves to the humanitarian side of the war effort. It never occurred to me, or to Mike I suspect, that we were about to embark on a project that would eventually inspire a major drama series.</p><p><i>Home Fires</i> took a long time to research and write. It was by no means an easy book as there was almost an embarrassment of material and yet very little in the way of &#x2018;voice&#x2019;, so I had to dig deep to find the heart of the wartime WI and the members who had kept the countryside ticking. Minutes and record books charted their activities and listed the immense quantities of herbs collected, fruit preserved and pies baked. It was only when I met women who had been wartime members, or whose mothers had been active in the WI during those years, that the personal stories added real life experience to those extraordinary achievements. Those are the stories that you will read in <i>Home Fires</i>.</p><p>Eventually I handed the manuscript to Mike in March 2012 and spent the summer dealing with editing questions and selecting images. This is a creative process because every image in the picture section has to earn its place and the all important captions have to justify their inclusion. In September 2012, about six months before the book was released in the UK, I signed up to go on an Arvon script-writing course. I felt I needed to try something new after writing ten books, to try a completely different discipline, which might present an interesting challenge. Spending a week at Totleigh Barton in Devon with an enthusiastic and diverse group was a wonderful experience, but within hours of starting the course I realised that this was not for me. I do not watch enough television and especially not the kind of series that my fellow students wanted to write. However, I was determined to get as much out of the course as possible so I threw myself into it with my customary enthusiasm. One of the tutors was Simon Block. When we met for a tutorial on the last day of the Arvon course he asked me what I did as a day job. I told him I was a writer and he laughed. &#x2018;I thought you were!&#x2019; he said. We both agreed that I should not give up the day job and I should continue to pursue my passion for storytelling.</p><p>That morning Mike Jones had sent me the final design for the hardback jacket. The mobile phone reception at Totleigh Barton being somewhat patchy, I had had to walk to the top of a hill to receive the email. I was thrilled with the jacket and I showed Simon the image on my phone. This started a conversation about women on the home front during the Second World War, one of enduring interest to me ever since I wrote <i>Stranger in the House</i> in 2008, which looked at the effect of returning men on the women of Britain after 1945. It was a little researched or understood subject, but one which had an enormous impact on the way society coped in the post-war years. <i>Home Fires</i> gave me another perspective on women in the countryside and the research for it produced some wonderful stories. As I was preparing to leave Totleigh Barton the following day, Simon took me aside and said: &#x2018;Julie, I think <i>Home Fires</i> has the potential to be enormous.&#x2019; Actually, he was even more extravagant than that. I doubt that either of us had the slightest inkling that we were about to embark upon what I can only describe as an incredible journey.</p><p>I returned to Oxford and carried on with life as normal, finishing the proofs of the book and considering what I might write next. Four weeks later I received an email from Simon telling me about a conversation he had had with a friend who worked as a television producer at ITV Studios. She would like to meet me, he wrote, and I was sure to like her because she had worked on <i>Foyle&#x2019;s War</i>. This was recommendation enough. I met Catherine Oldfield, then a development producer at ITV Studios, in Covent Garden. My diary for that day, 22 October, records &#x2018;lunch at le Deuxieme. Evening lecture at Eastbourne Congress theatre. Many miles covered.&#x2019; Quite the understatement as it turned out. At that lunch I agreed to send Catherine a draft of <i>Home Fires</i> and she in turn asked me to scribble down any ideas I might have about the type of setting that could work for a drama series. Well, I had been on a script-writing course, hadn&#x2019;t I? The following week she wrote to tell me that the book had made her cry and that she would like me to meet Francis Hopkinson, Creative Director of Drama at ITV Studios, to discuss buying the &#x2018;option&#x2019; for it. To my delight, Simon Block was signed up as the series creator and writer. Simon is a key player in so many ways and since we first met he has become an inspiration and a friend. He, Catherine and I spent a day at my home in Oxford before Christmas turning ideas over and over. It stands out in my mind as the most wonderful, creative and exhausting day I have ever spent. By the end of it Simon had begun to draw three characters, two sisters and a young man, who would be the first creations in his drama. It was so exciting to watch him conceive completely fictional characters, pulling them out of the air, as it were. They seemed to me to be ghostly shadows that would eventually become solid human forms inhabited by actors. My contribution to those discussions, as it has been ever since, was as a historical consultant. Not just facts but tone, mood and detail about the WI as well as some history of Cheshire, which is the county of my birth and in which the drama was to be set. I felt the county offered so much scope. With Liverpool and Manchester as its (then) two major cities, the Battle of the Atlantic, the war&#x2019;s longest running battle, and the huge number of camps&nbsp;&#x2013; army, air force, German and Italian prisoner of war and Polish Resettlement&nbsp;&#x2013; plus the Wirral, and the neighbouring counties of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire and North Wales, there would be no shortage of material or incidents to draw upon.</p><p>Over the ensuing months Simon produced an outline and then a first script. Reading that was a very special and precious moment. Finally a version of that script was submitted to the ITV commissioners and I received a telephone call from Catherine one afternoon telling me that &#x2018;we&#x2019; had the green light to make a show of six episodes. That day, 18 March 2014, I wrote in my diary &#x2018;HOME FIRES ARE GO!&#x2019;. As with everything to do with this series, that was an understatement. What had appeared to move at glacial pace now accelerated to a hundred miles an hour. Within a month I found myself sitting in a script development meeting at The London Television Centre talking about the National Register of 1939, the beginning of rationing in 1940 and the running of a secret ballot WI style. Over three days we bounced ideas around while Catherine tried to keep everything in order, writing notes all over the walls. By the end of the third morning we had rough outlines for episodes two to six.</p><p>I have been so very fortunate that Simon and Catherine have allowed me to be involved in the scripts, not in the writing of course, but in the historical detail and in the tone. It is difficult to capture the mood in the country in the first weeks and months of the war, and most especially in the early summer of 1940 when the most likely outcome was an invasion of Britain. We know the way the war ended, but at that stage it was far from clear. I felt that each episode had to match the prevailing mood of the time and this is certainly something that Simon has woven into the scripts.</p><p>At one point during the script development meeting Simon said, &#x2018;I have a question for you to which I don&#x2019;t think you will know the answer. What day did it start snowing in 1940?&#x2019; To his surprise and my slight embarrassment, I did know. A big WI agricultural meeting, scheduled to take place on 31 January in London, had to be cancelled as it had started snowing heavily four days earlier and transport was impossible. Trains were marooned, villages all over the country cut off and two days before the meeting there were snowdrifts ten to twelve feet deep in places. My family all know that I am, like my father, fascinated by the weather and I love the shipping forecast, so it is not really a surprise that I had paid attention to such a dramatic weather event. Since then I have been consulted on any number of questions to do with the WI, the war or the home front. One day my phone buzzed while I was having lunch with my mother and aunt. Sophie Bicknell, the show&#x2019;s script editor, wanted to know what the price of a pot of jam would have been in 1939. It was an urgent request because the art department was dressing the set for a scene to be shot that afternoon. Fortunately Mum, Jane and I managed to work it out (about 1s 3d) and I could ring Sophie back minutes later.</p><p>By August it was time for the first read-through. To hear the words of the scripts spoken by actors for the first time was powerful and emotional. Simon&#x2019;s scripts came alive in a whole new way for me and I began to hear the voices of the women he had created and given life and character to. Three weeks later I drove up to Cheshire for my first set visit. Nothing could have prepared me for the thrill of seeing the black and white world that I have known for the last fifteen years through pictures, words, diaries and books come alive.</p><p>The team were filming the opening sequence to the series. So, no spoiler alert. Steph Farrow and her son, Little Stan, were driving a herd of shorthorn cattle into a Cheshire farmyard. Simple as that. But for me it was an emotional explosion. There were smells, so familiar from my childhood but now linked to Simon&#x2019;s drama. There was noise, colour, movement, heat and energy. It was overwhelming and I had tears in my eyes...</p></p><h2>War Factory: Transformation Book Two</h2><p>Thorvald Spear, resurrected from his death over a hundred years earlier, continues to hunt Penny Royal, the rogue AI and dangerous war criminal on the run from Polity forces.

The silver medal, inscribed with the words 'In the Service of Humanity', was created to acknowledge those 'whose selfless actions preserved life in the face of persecution'.<br>&nbsp;<br>Some, like Frank Foley, a British spy whose cover was working at the British embassy in Berlin, took huge risks issuing forged visas to enable around 10,000 Jews to escape Germany before the outbreak of war. Others, like the ten British POWs who hid and cared for Hannah Sarah Rigler as she escaped from a death march, showed great humanity in the face of horrendous cruelty and suffering. All the recipients of the award were ordinary people, acting on no one's authority but their own, who found they could not stand idly by in the face of this great evil. <i>Heroes of the Holocaust </i>collects for the first time the remarkable stories of the recipients of the medal.

Dimont, author of <b>The Indestructible Jews, The Jews in America, The Amazing Adventures of the Jewish People,</b> and <b>Appointment in Jerusalem</b>, was born in Helsinki, Finland, and came to the United States in 1930. He taught himself English by reading Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays, the Bible, and American plays translated into Finnish. After serving in intelligence with the U.S. Army during World War II, he worked in public relations and employee relations for Edison Brothers Stores in St. Louis. Following the first publication of the bestselling <b>Jews, God and History</b>, he lectured extensively on Jewish history throughout the United States, Canada, South Africa, Brazil, and Finland until his death in 1992.</p>Referencing the Old Testament and Palestine&#39;s influence on world civilization, Finnish-American Dimont&#39;s secular history of the Jewish people was a surprise bestseller when originally published, and it has remained in print for more than twenty years. Deservedly so, for, despite quibbles from historians and religious partisans, the author has turned four thousand years in the life of one people into a lively, canny, authoritative, brainy and informative page-turner. To appreciate this audio, one must accept the kind of trade-offs encountered when a work that exists in space is translated into a work that exists in time. These include the inability to refer to indices, improbabilities of translating charts and graphs to sound, troubles going back and forth with footnotes, the need for heavy concentration to absorb the sheer density of data. On the plus side, one enjoys the accurate pronunciation of foreign words and phrases, as well as the narrator&#39;s animation of concepts and events. Anna Fields does a nice job here. Her listener-friendly cadences express not only the sense of the lines, but also the connections among ideas and the author&#39;s underlying intelligence. Be that as it may, to get the most out of the recording, one must still follow along with the text. Y.R.

Unless they can find what connects these victims, someone else may soon be killed.

Aim�e was born in Cuba. The Thurlos live in Corrales, New Mexico.</p>ONE<br>&nbsp;<br><br>Tribal Police Investigator Ella Clah stood next to her department&#x2019;s cruiser, a dusty, white SUV that had more miles on it than a Two Grey Hills sheepdog. As she stood beneath the shade of the Quick Mart station&#x2019;s island, watching the dollar amount shoot past fifty as the pump fed regular into the tank, her second cousin and partner, Justine Goodluck, was busy cleaning the windshield.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been so quiet lately,&#x201d; Justine said. &#x201c;I hate slow days. I&#x2019;d rather be up to my ears in an investigation than catching up with paperwork. It&#x2019;s nine in the morning and it already feels like we&#x2019;ve been on duty all day.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hear you,&#x201d; Ella answered. &#x201c;At least we&#x2019;re not behind a desk.&#x201d;<br>Justine stopped working on the windshield and looked directly at Ella. Although among Traditionalists that would have been considered extremely rude, tribal cops had learned to walk the line between the old and the new, adapting to a reservation in transition.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s eating you, partner?&#x201d; Justine asked. Seeing Ella shrug, Justine added, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try to tell me it&#x2019;s nothing. We&#x2019;ve known each other too long.&#x201d;<br>There were many advantages to working with a close partner but the ability to second-guess each other was often a two-edged sword. With some partnerships, familiarity bred contempt, as the old saying warned. Yet Justine and she had found a middle ground. Though they weren&#x2019;t what Ella&#x2019;s daughter would have termed BFFs, they&#x2019;d become attuned to each other in a way that gave them a distinct advantage out in the field.<br>Ella was still thinking of how to answer that when a call came over their radio. &#x201c;S.I. Unit One, see the clerk at the First United Bank on Highway 64, east of the bridge. He reports a man posing as Chester Kelewood is trying to cash a two-hundred-dollar check. The clerk will try to stall the subject until you arrive.&#x201d;<br>Ella hung the gas nozzle back onto the pump and reached inside the open window to pick up the mike. &#x201c;Unit One responding,&#x201d; Ella said as Justine paid the bill.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re less than a mile from there,&#x201d; Justine said, slipping behind the wheel. &#x201c;How do you want to handle this?&#x201d;<br>Ella began accessing information on the MDT, Mobile Dispatch Terminal. As her partner eased out into downtown Shiprock traffic, she answered, &#x201c;Chester Kelewood has been on our missing person&#x2019;s list since last June second, and in these situations the bank always flags their accounts. Let&#x2019;s go in silent and try to get next to this scam artist before he catches on.&#x201d;<br>A few minutes later, Justine dropped Ella off near the bank&#x2019;s front door, then headed for the closest parking slot. As Ella approached the entrance, an anxious-looking man stepped outside&#x2014;not Kelewood, judging from the image she&#x2019;d just viewed on the terminal. She hesitated, wondering if this was the suspect or just another patron.<br>His gaze shifted to the badge clipped to her belt and a second later, he spun around and bolted down the sidewalk.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s him!&#x201d; a man in the foyer yelled.<br>Ella raced after the man, who darted around the corner of the building.<br>Although he&#x2019;d only had a slight lead, the man moved like the wind, fear of arrest undoubtedly motivating him. He reached the back corner of the bank, then disappeared down the alley to his left.<br>Just as Ella appeared in the alley, he reached a six-foot cinder-block wall. Seeing her closing in, he scrambled clumsily over the top.<br>Ella followed, jumping up, then over. This was a lot easier than the ten-foot barrier at the county police academy&#x2019;s obstacle course. Dropping to her knees to absorb the shock of landing, she searched the perimeter and quickly spotted the suspect. The Navajo man was hightailing it down a dirt road.<br>She hit Justine&#x2019;s speed-dial number on her cell phone, slowing just enough to make the call. &#x201c;Justine, I&#x2019;m in pursuit. Drive down the ditch road and try to cut him off. He&#x2019;s heading north through the brush.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Roger that,&#x201d; Justine replied, then hung up.<br>Ella continued pursuit into the <i>bosque</i>, the wooded area that lined the riverbanks. She knew she couldn&#x2019;t match his sprint speed in a 440 or less, but she was sure she could wear him down cross-country, providing she could keep him within sight or track him. Even as she processed this thought, the man raced fifty yards down the road, then cut right and disappeared into a clump of twelve-foot-high willows, red and gray-green from their early summer growth.<br>Less than ten seconds behind, she ducked in after him. Ella could hear his labored breathing and the thump of his boots on the sand as he ran parallel to the San Juan River, here only about a hundred yards wide. Although there were steep bluffs on the opposite shore, on this side there were many possible exits back along the north bank. She&#x2019;d have to be careful he didn&#x2019;t slip back into town. Hopefully, Justine would see him if he crossed the ditch road.<br>The path the suspect had chosen kept him close to the river. The chase required constant swerving and twisting to avoid getting whipped by the long willow branches or tripping on a tuft of salt grass. Ella found herself constantly ducking and throwing up her right or left arm to avoid being, literally, bush whacked.<br>She&#x2019;d already eased into her long-distance running rhythm: two strides, inhale, two strides, exhale. She knew from her regular conditioning runs that she&#x2019;d be able to keep up this pace for miles. Even with the heavy ballistic vest she always wore under her shirt, she&#x2019;d catch up sooner or later. Unfortunately, the moment he realized that, he might turn on her, so she&#x2019;d have to be ready.<br>Still on his tail, she remained alert, forcing herself to keep her breathing smooth and regular. Even if she hadn&#x2019;t been able to hear him crashing through the brush like an enraged bull, his tracks were easy to follow. Soon she noticed that he was angling steadily toward the river. The bluffs a quarter mile farther down were lower and receded from the banks, leaving easier access to the shore and possible escape. Maybe he&#x2019;d decided to swim for it next&#x2014;though it was probably more of a deep wade or wallow unless he dropped into a pool or undercut in the bank.<br>Suddenly Ella stopped hearing his footsteps. She slowed to a brisk walk and listened carefully. Almost instinctively, she reached up to touch the turquoise badger fetish hanging from a leather strap around her neck.<br>Her brother, Clifford, a medicine man, or <i>hataalii</i> as they were known to the <i>Din�</i>, the Navajo People, had given her the Zuni-made fetish years ago as a gift. Since that time, she&#x2019;d noticed that the small carving invariably became hot whenever danger was near. Right now it felt uncomfortably warm. Though she&#x2019;d never been able to explain it, she suspected that the heat it emitted might have something to do with her own rising body temperature in times of crisis. Either way, she&#x2019;d learned to trust the warning.<br>Ella stopped and slowly turned around in a circle, detecting the acrid scent of sweat&#x2014;not her own. Before she could pinpoint it more accurately, a man burst out from behind a salt cedar, yelling as he swung a big chunk of driftwood like a baseball bat.<br>Ella ducked and the wood whooshed over her head, missing her skull by inches. Before he could take another swing, Ella drew her weapon and aimed it at her assailant.<br>&#x201c;Drop the stick, buddy, now!&#x201d; she ordered.<br>The man dropped the branch, but dove to his right, rolling into some tall grass. Then, leaping back to his feet, he sprinted away.<br>&#x201c;Crap!&#x201d; Ella holstered her gun and took off after him again. No way this jackrabbit was going to get away from her.<br>Running out of steam, the panting suspect tried to leap a fallen cottonwood branch, but caught his toe, or misjudged the jump. He fell to the sand, face-first.<br>Ella caught up to him a second later, but he swung around, still on his knees, and dove for her feet. He grabbed her boot and twisted her leg, trying to knock her down. Ella broke free and recaptured her balance just as the guy leaped up and lunged.<br>Ella kicked him in the chest with her heavy boot.<br>The impact stopped him in his tracks, and he gasped. He was wobbling back and forth, but somehow he stayed on his feet. He took a step back, then held up his fists, waving them to and fro like a fighter working out in a gym as he took a bob-and-weave defense.<br>Ella kept her fighting stance. &#x201c;Stop. I&#x2019;m a cop. Don&#x2019;t fight me. You&#x2019;ll go down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You wish,&#x201d; the Navajo man yelled, his face beet red from exertion.<br>&#x201c;Have it your way,&#x201d; Ella said, and reached for the canister of Mace on her duty belt. She had it halfway up before his fists suddenly opened up. Showing his palms and outspread fingers, he took a step back.<br>&#x201c;No, stop! I&#x2019;m allergic to that stuff. Really. I give up.&#x201d;<br>Ella immediately spun him around and cuffed him. &#x201c;If you run for it again, I&#x2019;ll Taser your ass.&#x201d;<br>Taking him by the arm, she informed him of his rights as she guided him east toward the dirt road that paralleled the <i>bosque</i> along the irrigation ditch. As he stumbled along she asked him for his name, but all she got was a request for an attorney.<br>By the time they reached the road, a patrol cruiser was waiting, having come from the north. Justine was inching up from the south in her unit, less than fifty yards away. Ella looked at the uniformed officer climbing out of the cruiser. She recognized Mark Lujan, a young cop with about four years on the tribal force. &#x201c;Thanks, Lujan, but I&#x2019;ve got him now. My partner and I will take him in,&#x201d; she said, seeing Justine climbing out of the SUV.<br>&#x201c;Let the officer take him, boss,&#x201d; Justine said, leaning her head out of the SUV. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got another call.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening, partner?&#x201d; Ella asked, climbing into the vehicle.<br>Justine turned the SUV around, then spoke as they drove toward the highway. &#x201c;A Navajo crew was replacing fence posts on the Navajo Nation side of the border, just the other side of Hogback, when they found a body.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;On tribal land&#x2014;they&#x2019;re sure of that?&#x201d; Ella reached for a tissue from the glove box, then wiped away the perspiration from her brow with one hand and redirected the air-conditioning vent toward her face and neck.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, from what I was told. They called 911 and dispatch called us immediately.&#x201d;<br>There was no direct route to the site. When they passed through the wide, river-cut gap in the Hogback, the long, steep-sided outcrop towering above the desert for miles, Justine had to continue east off the Rez. Their intended route required them to circle back to the northwest along the old highway, which came much closer to the spinelike ridge.<br>There was a dirt track that ran along the north-south fence line through an old field and former marsh, and the ride was extra rough. Trees and brush dotted the area, thickly in some places, and it took a while to spot the tribal truck, which was in a low spot. The tailgate of the oversized pickup was down and the bed filled with coils of wire and fence posts.<br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the crew?&#x201d; Ella asked, looking around.<br>&#x201c;Way over there,&#x201d; Justine said, gesturing with her chin, Navajo-style, toward a shady spot beneath an old cottonwood at least a hundred feet northwest of the pickup.<br>Ella wasn&#x2019;t surprised. As a detective on the Navajo Rez, she usually didn&#x2019;t have to worry that a murder scene would be contaminated by the Navajo public. Whether they were Traditionalists, New Traditionalists, or Modernists, fear of the <i>chindi</i> was a fact of life here.<br>The <i>chindi</i>, the evil in a man, was said to remain earthbound waiting for a chance to create problems for the living. Contact with the dead, or their possessions, was a sure way to summon it to you, so avoidance was the usual strategy.<br>The foreman, a short, muscular Navajo in jeans and a pale blue tribal-issue shirt, came to meet them as they parked and stepped out of the SUV. His yellow straw cowboy hat was stained with dust and sweat. It was getting hot already here in northwest New Mexico. &#x201c;We called you as soon as we realized what we were digging up. You can see what&#x2019;s left of a human hand down there. It&#x2019;s over by that spot where we were taking out some fill dirt.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks. We&#x2019;ll handle it from here,&#x201d; Ella said.<br>Justine joined Ella and they approached the location he&#x2019;d pointed out. A shovel had been left beside the area where sand had been scooped out, probably to fill around a newly planted fence post about ten feet away. The original ground had been eroded by heavy rain and the old post still lay nearby, the wood badly rotted.<br>Ella and Justine moved carefully, stepping only in the fresh shoe and boot prints left by the work crew and making sure no other potential evidence was disturbed.<br>&#x201c;Our crime scene team is on the way,&#x201d; Justine said, looking down at the dark, leathery-looking, dried out remnants of what was clearly a human&#x2019;s right hand. &#x201c;Benny&#x2019;s driving the van. Ralph Tache wants in on this, too. He said he can&#x2019;t dig&#x2014;doctor&#x2019;s orders&#x2014;but he can collect evidence and document the scene.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about that,&#x201d; Ella said, giving Justine a look of concern. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure Ralph&#x2019;s ready. This could be labor intensive, and we&#x2019;ll have to do it all by hand. We can&#x2019;t bring in a backhoe, and all that bending over...&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ralph&#x2019;s had a lot to deal with after all those surgeries. That pipe bomb incident at the college did more than just put him in the hospital. But he&#x2019;s spent months in rehab, and needs to get back to work, Ella. His doctor&#x2019;s given permission for him to resume field duty, and the chief agreed. Let him have this assignment. He&#x2019;s not cut out for a desk job, and we need our best personnel on this.&#x201d;<br>Ella nodded. Although Ralph had already made it clear he wasn&#x2019;t ready to take up his bomb squad work again, he wanted to get out of the station and take part in fieldwork.<br>&#x201c;After all those months of recovery and therapy, I thought for a while he&#x2019;d just take an early retirement and go on to consulting work,&#x201d; Ella said. &#x201c;He was a veteran cop when I joined the department.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think police work&#x2019;s in his blood, Ella, and he needs to reconnect.&#x201d; Justine glanced down at the missing joint on her index finger, recalling the brutality of her kidnappers years ago. &#x201c;We all pay a price for what we do, but police work&#x2019;s a calling. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re drawn to it so much.&#x201d;<br>Ella said nothing. Justine was a devout Christian and her religious beliefs shaped her views. Yet no matter how Justine defined it, she lived and breathed the job, too. It was that dedication to the tribe and the department that made all of them overlook the downside&#x2014;like the crappy pay and long hours.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll start with photos,&#x201d; Justine said. &#x201c;I want shots of the tire tracks on the dirt trail leading in. I saw two distinct, fresh sets as we were coming in, and there&#x2019;s only one tribal vehicle here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good eye. I&#x2019;ll get statements from the crew,&#x201d; Ella said.<br>As she walked over to the men clustered in the shade of the cottonwood, Ella understood the wariness in their eyes. She spoke to the foreman first and he pointed out the two men who&#x2019;d found the body. One of them, a stocky Navajo in his early twenties wearing a turquoise and black Shiprock High School Chieftains tee-shirt and worn jeans, stood fingering the leather pouch at his waist.<br>Recognizing the medicine bag for what it was, an essential personal item for Traditionalists, Ella decided to speak to him first.<br>She introduced herself wi...</p><h2>The Little Book of Tourists in Iceland: Tips, tricks, and what the Icelanders really think of you</h2><p>Iceland is in the midst of an unprecedented tourist boom that has brought wealth to the country, but also myriad issues and challenges.

A graduate of Oral Roberts University with an M.A. in Communications from Wheaton College Graduate School, she has published numerous articles in Christian magazines. All the Way Home is her third novel. She and her husband, Bob, along with their daughter, Laura Jane, live in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Against the turbulent backdrop of the Vietnam War, journalist Augie Schuler Callahan reflects on her girlhood in 1938 Los Angeles as she travels to a small Southern town to cover a story. She fondly recalls the Japanese American family who all but adopted her and her friendship with their daughter, Sunny, and agonizes over the end of their relationship when Sunny's family was sent to an internment camp after the attack on Pearl Harbor. When Augie arrives in Mississippi, she discovers that the woman who convinced her to come is Sunny, who is working to establish voting rights for blacks. As the two get reacquainted, they become involved in the conflict between the Ku Klux Klan and the local African American community. Tatlock (A Place Called Morning) writes well, but her emphasis on drawn-out scenes of injustice at the expense of the small, more human elements make her clever juxtaposition of the social issues-the civil rights struggle of the 1960s and the incarceration of Japanese Americans in the 1940s-less thought-provoking and fascinating than it could have been. (For example, while she goes into excessive detail depicting a sit-in on the lawn of a courthouse, Tatlock spends less time exploring Sunny's complicated decision to have plastic surgery to alter her Japanese appearance.) While there are more overt Christian elements than in her first novel, A Room of My Own, a brief, unflattering scene of a priest in a Catholic church may offend some. However, multicultural characters are still a novelty in Christian fiction, so this is recommended for most collections. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thoughts on the East (New Directions Bibelot)</h2><p><p><strong>An ecumenical anthology,&nbsp;Thoughts on the East&nbsp;gathers Merton&#x2019;s essential definitions of the religions that so much interested him&#x2015;Taoism, Buddhism (in many forms, but especially Zen), Sufism, and Hinduism.&nbsp;</strong></p> Unified by Merton&#x2019;s belief that East and West share &#x201c;a unity of outlook and purpose, a common spiritual climate,&#x201d; this eclectic selection also offers a fascinating introduction by the late George Woodcock, author of the acclaimed critical study,&nbsp;Thomas Merton: Monk and Poet.</p><p>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) entered the Cistercian Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky, following his conversion to Catholicism and was ordained in 1949.

Auden&#39;s light verse, assembled by his literary executor.</p><p>W. H. Auden once defined light verse as the kind that is written by poets who are democratically in tune with their audience and whose language is straightforward and close to general speech. Given that definition, the 123 poems in this collection all qualify; they are as accessible as popular songs yet have the wisdom and profundity of the greatest poetry. <br>As I Walked Out One Evening contains some of Auden's most memorable verse: "Now Through the Night's Caressing Grip," "Lullaby: Lay your Sleeping Head, My Love," "Under Which Lyre," and "Funeral Blues." Alongside them are less familiar poems, including seventeen that have never before appeared in book form. Here, among toasts, ballads, limericks, and even a foxtrot, are "Song: The Chimney Sweepers," a jaunty evocation of love, and the hilarious satire "Letter to Lord Byron." By turns lyrical, tender, sardonic, courtly, and risque, As I Walked Out One Evening is Auden at his most irresistible and affecting.W. H. Auden was born in York in 1907 and brought up in Birmingham. His first book, Poems, was published by T. S. Eliot at Faber in 1930. He went to Spain during the civil war, to Iceland (with Louis MacNeice) and later travelled to China. In 1939 he and Christopher Isherwood left for America, where Auden spent the next fifteen years lecturing, reviewing, writing poetry and opera librettos, and editing anthologies. He became an American citizen in 1946, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1948. In 1956 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford, and a year later went to live in Kirchstetten in Austria, after spending several summers on Ischia. He died in Vienna in 1973.</p><h2>Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons: A Calvin and Hobbes Collection</h2><p>Calvin and Hobbes are back.

Dante's writings are therefore never far away in this authoritative and comprehensive intellectual biography, which offers a fresh account of the medieval Florentine poet's life and thought before and after his exile in 1302.</p><p>Beginning with the often violent circumstances of Dante's life, the book examines his successive works as testimony to the course of his passionate humanity: his lyric poetry through to the <i>Vita nova</i> as the great work of his first period; the <i>Convivio</i>, <i>De vulgari eloquentia</i> and the poems of his early years in exile; and the <i>Monarchia</i> and the <i>Commedia</i> as the product of his maturity. Describing as it does a journey of the mind, the book confirms the nature of Dante's undertaking as an exploration of what he himself speaks of as "maturity in the flame of love."</p><p>The result is an original synthesis of Dante's life and work.</p></p><p><b>John Took</b> is Professor Emeritus of Dante Studies at University College London. His books include <i>L'Etterno Piacer: Aesthetic Ideas in Dante</i> and <i>Dante, Lyric Poet and Philosopher: An Introduction to the Minor Works.</i>"John Took offers a splendidly comprehensive and well-informed account of Dante's work. Full weight is given to the ways in which the poet's writings reflect and respond to historical context. But above all the poetry itself is seen, rightly and enthusiastically, as a 'coruscation of delight.' "<b>&#x2015;Robin Kirkpatrick, University of Cambridge </b><br><br>"A magisterial work, the result of a lifetime's devoted engagement with Dante's work and all that went into making the man and the poetry."<b>&#x2015;Corinna Salvadori Lonergan, Fellow Emeritus, Trinity College, Dublin</b><br><br>"A beautiful book that reflects decades of thinking and teaching on Dante.

In this case, there are three.</i> Stella Crater, the judge's wife, is the picture of propriety draped in long pearls and the latest Chanel. Ritzi, a leggy showgirl with Broadway aspirations, thinks moonlighting in the judge's bed is the quickest way off the chorus line. Maria Simon, the dutiful maid, has the judge to thank for her husband's recent promotion to detective in the NYPD. Meanwhile, Crater is equally indebted to Tammany Hall leaders and the city's most notorious gangster, Owney "The Killer" Madden.<br><br>On a sultry summer night, as rumors circulate about the judge's involvement in wide-scale political corruption, the Honorable Joseph Crater steps into a cab and disappears without a trace. <i>Or does he?</i><br><br>After 39 years of necessary duplicity, Stella Crater is finally ready to reveal what she knows. Sliding into a plush leather banquette at Club Abbey, the site of many absinthe-soaked affairs and the judge's favorite watering hole back in the day, Stella orders two whiskeys on the rocks&#x2014;one for her and one in honor of her missing husband. Stirring the ice cubes in the lowball glass, Stella begins to tell a tale&#x2014;of greed, lust, and deceit. As the novel unfolds and the women slyly break out of their prescribed roles, it becomes clear that each knows more than she has initially let on.<br><br>With a layered intensity and prose as effervescent as the bubbly that flows every night, <i>The Wife, the Maid, and the Mistress</i> is a wickedly entertaining historical mystery that will transport readers to a bygone era with tipsy spins through subterranean jazz clubs and backstage dressing rooms. But beneath the Art Deco skyline and amid the intoxicating smell of smoke and whiskey, the question of why Judge Crater disappeared lingers seductively until a twist in the very last pages.</p><p>Joshilyn Jackson Ariel Lawhon <p><b>Joshilyn Jackson interviews Ariel Lawhon, author of <i>The Wife, the Maid, and the Mistress: A Novel</i></b></p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Joshilyn: Your novel revisits an unsolved mystery of Old New York. How did you first find it? What about it made you want to use the truth as a vehicle to drive your own story?</b> <p></p> <p>Ariel: I&#x2019;d never heard of Joseph Crater until I read an article about him in <i>The New York Post</i> nine years ago. I didn&#x2019;t know that his disappearance was the biggest missing person&#x2019;s case of the twentieth century or that he was a household name for almost fifty years. It was fascinating. But in all of that, what intrigued me most was his wife Stella, and her strange yearly ritual. Starting on the first anniversary of her husband&#x2019;s disappearance, she would go to a bar in Greenwich Village and order two drinks. She&#x2019;d raise one in salute, &#x201c;Good luck, Joe, wherever you are!&#x201d; Then she&#x2019;d drink it and walk out of the bar, leaving the other untouched on the table. She did this every year for thirty-nine years. After reading that article Stella Crater took up permanent residence in my mind. I&#x2019;d close my eyes and she&#x2019;d be there, in that corner booth, a glass of whiskey in her hand, practically daring me to tell her story. So I did.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Joshilyn: You have blended actual historical events so seamlessly into your fiction that I can&#x2019;t tell where truth ends and your imagination takes over. How did you create this world?</b> <p></p> <p>Ariel: The real Crater mystery is filled with all these fascinating but seemingly disconnected details: mysterious cash-filled envelopes, theater tickets, grand jury investigations, random injuries, missing wills, bribery allegations. I wanted to take all the peripheral details that are often nothing more than footnotes in the historical record and make them integral to the story. But this could only be done when put in contrast with the real people involved: crooked politicians, seedy gangsters, an uncooperative wife, ambitious dancing girls, theater moguls, police officers, nosey reporters. It was all there for the taking but there were gaps. Big questions no one could answer with any certainty, not the least of which is what actually happened to Judge Crater. So I took the details I could verify (hello research you are my drug) and then arranged the blank spaces to fit my own theories. In the end, it became a portrait of what could have happened.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Joshilyn: You have three narrators - which of them is least like you? And did that distance make it easier or harder to write her?</b> <p></p> <p>Ariel: Don&#x2019;t be like me. Don&#x2019;t write three different stories centered on the same missing man and then try to weave them together into a cohesive whole. You will feel like you&#x2019;re sewing up a bag of cats. And you will, inevitably, find that one character is easier to write than the others (Ritzi). You will like her best even though you aren&#x2019;t supposed to play favorites. This will do strange things to your moral compass, because you like the mistress best. One of the characters will be cold and elusive and you will have nothing in common with her (Stella). She will scare you a little bit and make you doubt your own ability at every turn. Her name will become an expletive. And then there will be one that surprises you (Maria). She will be both devout and sensual. You will make her do things that cause you unreasonable guilt given her imaginary status. You will lose sleep. In the end she will break your heart.</p> <p><b></b></p> <b>Joshilyn: Where do you do your writing?</b> <p></p> <p>Ariel: Anywhere. Everywhere. The first flat surface I can find that isn&#x2019;t littered with Legos or used Band Aids. The better question would probably be when do you write (answer: whenever white space shows up on the calendar). Apparently there is this thing called biology. And it WORKS. So thanks to biology I have four children. All of them boys. All of them highly intelligent and off-the-charts active. We call them The Wild Rumpus. And we will not buy nice things until they grow up and leave home. So the when and where of writing is a daily tightrope walk for me. It&#x2019;s probably not the best way to write books but it&#x2019;s the only way I know how and it seems to be working well so far.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p>Co-founder of the popular reading blog <i>SheReads</i>, ARIEL LAWHON lives in Nashville with her husband and four boys.</p><h2>Pride &amp; Prejudice</h2><p>Tailored from the adored Jane Austen classic, Marvel Comics is proud to present PRIDE AND PREJUDICE!

Affected by a rare and fatal neuromuscular disease, Mattie lived almost fourteen years but in that time became a poet, best-selling author, peace activist, and a prominent voice for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Before his death in June 2004, his five volumes of Heartsongs poetry sold more than a million copies.<br><br><i>Reflections of a Peacemaker: A Portrait Through Heartsongs</i> is the final collection of Heartsongs that Mattie was working on when he died.

Culled from the thousands of poems, essays, and journal entries Mattie left behind, the entries in <i>Reflections of a Peacemaker</i> create a portrait of Mattie in his own words. In these poems he explores disability, despair, and death but also the gifts he finds in nature, prayer, peace, and his belief in something "bigger and better than the here and now." The poems are grouped by theme such as playful, stormy, sacred, and final Heartsongs, with each section introduced by a personal tribute from the likes of Maya Angelou, Oprah Winfrey, Larry King, and former President Jimmy Carter.<br><br> In the words of Mattie's mother, Jeni Stepanek, who has published <i>Reflections of a Peacemaker</i> at her son's request, "In reading these poems we enter Mattie's world and gain insight through a child who somehow balanced pain and fear with optimism and faith."</p><p>Mattie J.T.

Each of the groups is given a distinctive color to make it easy to identify, and each muscle is shown in its relationship to the skeleton. Each gets a complete profile, including origin/insertion, action of the muscle, which nerve controls it, movements that use it, and exercises and stretches that strengthen it. The <i>Concise Book of Muscles</i> shows students exactly how to locate and identify specific muscles, highlighting those that are heavily used and therefore subject to injury in a variety of sports and activities. This expanded edition of a leading anatomy reference book includes 20 muscles not previously covered, adding greater depth to the original edition while remaining accessible and affordable.</p><p>Chris Jarmey<b>,</b> MCSP, DS, MRSS, has taught anatomy, shiatsu, qigong, and bodywork therapy throughout Europe.

Captain Jacob Van Zanten didn't just have a knack for flying. His attention to detail, methodical approach, and spotless record made him a natural choice to head KLM's safety program. It was no surprise, then, that the airline was keen to show him off. One magazine ad featuring the smiling captain captured it all: "KLM: from the people who made punctuality possible." Even seasoned pilots--not exactly the type of individuals prone to swoon--regarded him as something of a celebrity.<br><br>On the flight deck of the 747, en route from Amsterdam to Las Palmas Airport in the Canary Islands, Van Zanten must have felt a sense of pride. Today's trip was moving along with the smooth precision that had become his hallmark. The schedule was straightforward: land in Las Palmas, refuel, and transport a new set of passengers back home to Holland.<br><br>But then Van Zanten got an urgent message from air-traffic control. A terrorist bomb had exploded at the airport flower shop, causing massive chaos on the ground; Las Palmas would be closed until further notice.<br><br>The captain knew that at times like this the most important thing was to remain calm and proceed with caution. He had performed drills preparing for this kind of situation countless times. In fact, Van Zanten had just returned from leading a six-month safety course on how to react in exactly this kind of situation.<br><br>Following standard procedure, the captain obeyed orders to land fifty nautical miles from his original destination, on the island of Tenerife. There, at 1:10 p.m., his plane joined several others that had been similarly diverted.<br><br>Now, you don't need to be a seasoned airline pilot to appreciate that Tenerife was no JFK. It was a tiny airport, with a single runway not meant to support jumbo jets.<br><br>With his plane safely parked at the edge of the runway, the captain checked his watch. Seeing the time, he was struck with a worrisome thought: the mandated rest period.<br><br>The Dutch government had recently instituted strict, complicated rules to which every pilot had to adhere. After getting in touch with HQ and performing some quick calculations, Van Zanten figured the latest he could take off was 6:30 p.m. Flying after the start of his mandated rest period was out of the question--it wasn't just against policy; it was a crime punishable by imprisonment. But taking the rest period would open its own can of worms. Here in Tenerife there would be no replacement crew to take over. Hundreds of passengers would be stranded overnight. That would mean the airline would have to find them a place to stay, and there weren't enough hotel rooms on the island. In addition, a delay here would initiate a cascade of flight cancellations throughout KLM. A seemingly minor diversion could easily become a logistical nightmare.<br><br>It's easy to imagine the stress that Van Zanten was experiencing and why he became so determined to save time. It was like being stuck at a red light when you're late for a big meeting. Try as you might to stay calm, you know that your reputation is on the line; your frustration grows, and there's really not much you can do. But there was one thing Van Zanten could do: the captain decided to keep the passengers on board, so that when Las Palmas reopened, he could get back in the air immediately.<br><br>But the air-traffic control personnel who worked at Tenerife tower were of a different mind-set. Here was a small airport on a tropical island, now inundated with planes from all over the world that had been diverted because of the Las Palmas explosion. Not only was the tower understaffed, but the air-traffic controllers were in no hurry to get planes out of the gate; they were, in fact, getting ready to listen to a live soccer match on their transistor radios. Twenty minutes after landing, Van Zanten received word from the tower that he should let his passengers off: it looked like they would be here for a while.<br><br>From there, events at Tenerife continued to move forward like molasses. Twenty minutes turned into an hour. The captain spent every moment thinking of ways to minimize the delay. He held a strategy session with his crew. He called KLM headquarters to find out exactly how much time he had left before the mandated rest period kicked in. An hour on the ground had turned into two; then the captain came up with another idea. He decided to refuel at Tenerife and thus shave half an hour off the turnaround in Las Palmas.<br><br>But this time-saving idea backfired. As soon as Van Zanten started refueling, word came from Las Palmas that the airport had finally reopened. But it was too late to stop the thirty-five-minute refueling process.<br><br>Finally, just when it looked like the plane was set to go, nature threw its own wrench into the plan: a thick layer of fog descended upon the runway.<br><br>Kicking himself over his decision to refuel, Van Zanten became even more intent on getting under way. With the fog growing thicker, visibility dropped to just 300 meters--so poor that gazing out the cockpit window the captain couldn't see the end of the runway.<br><br>Van Zanten knew that every moment the fog got worse made it that much likelier that the Tenerife tower would shut down the airport. He saw that his window of opportunity to get out of Tenerife before an overnight stay was closing. It was now or never--time to go.<br><br>But what the captain did next was completely out of character. Van Zanten revved up the engines, and the plane lurched down the runway.<br><br>"Wait a minute," Van Zanten's copilot said in confusion. "We don't have ATC clearance."<br><br>"I know that," replied the captain as he hit the brakes. "Go ahead and ask."<br><br>The copilot got on the radio and received airway clearance--approval of the flight plan. But the tower said nothing about the vital <i>takeoff</i> clearance. And yet, determined to take off, Van Zanten turned the throttles to full power and roared down the foggy runway.<br><br>The jumbo jet was gaining momentum when, seemingly out of nowhere, the scariest sight Van Zanten could have imagined appeared before him. A Pan Am 747 was parked across the runway, and Van Zanten was approaching it at take-off speed.<br><br>There was no way to stop or swerve. Instinctively, Van Zanten knew that his only chance was to take off early. "Come on! Please!" the captain urged his plane. He pulled the aircraft's nose up desperately, dragging its tail on the ground and throwing up a blinding spray of sparks.<br><br>The nose of Van Zanten's plane managed to narrowly clear the parked 747. But just when it looked like he was in the clear, the underside of Van Zanten's fuselage ripped through the top of the Pan Am plane.<br><br>The KLM plane burst into a fiery explosion as it hurtled another five hundred yards down the runway.<br><br>Van Zanten, his entire crew, and all of his passengers were killed. In all, 584 people lost their lives that day.<br><br>The aeronautical community was stunned. It was by far the deadliest airplane collision in history. An international team of experts descended on Tenerife airport. They examined every bit of evidence, interviewed the eyewitnesses, and scrutinized every moment of the cockpit recorders in an attempt to pinpoint the cause of the accident.<br><br>The experts quickly ruled out a mechanical failure or terrorist attack. Piecing together the events of that day, it was clear that the other plane on the runway, Pan Am Flight 1736, had missed a taxiway turnoff and ended up in the wrong place. The thick fog contributed to the disaster. Van Zanten couldn't see the Pan Am plane, the Pan Am pilot couldn't see him, and the tower controllers couldn't see either one of them. On top of that, the tower was undermanned and the controllers were distracted by the day's events.<br><br>Despite all these factors, though, the tragedy would never have occurred if Van Zanten hadn't taken off without clearance. Why would this seasoned pilot, the <i>head of safety</i> at the airline, make such a rash and irresponsible decision?<br><br>The best explanation the investigators could come up with was that Van Zanten was feeling frustrated. But that didn't quite add up. Feeling frustrated is one thing; completely disregarding protocol and forgetting about safety is another.<br><br>Clearly, Van Zanten was experienced. Clearly, he was well trained. And clearly, he was good at what he did. How could he cast aside every bit of training and protocol when the stakes were so high?<br><br>The aeronautical experts turned over every stone in their search for an explanation. But there was something in Tenerife that remained completely hidden. Alongside the rolling fog and crowded airfield, an unseen psychological force was at work, steering Van Zanten off the path of reason.<br><br>A growing body of research reveals that our behavior and decision making are influenced by an array of such psychological undercurrents and that they are much more powerful and pervasive than most of us realize. The interesting thing about these forces is that, like streams, they converge to become even more powerful. As we follow these streams, we notice unlikely connections among events that lie along their banks: the actions of an investor help us to better understand presidential decision making; students buying theater tickets illuminate a bitter controversy in the archeological community over human evolution; NBA draft picks point to a fatal flaw in common job-interview procedures; women talking on the phone show why a shaky bridge can be a powerful aphrodisiac.<br><br>Charting these psychological undercurrents and their unexpected effects, we can see where the currents are strongest and how their dynamics help us under...</p><h2>Time Travelers: Fiction in the Fourth Dimension</h2><p>Time Travelers gathers twenty-four tales by the most recognizable names in the genre.

Mining Italian sources and incorporating Pasolini's own writings, Scientific American contributor Schwartz sets the stage with an absorbing account of Pasolini's 1975 murder at the hands of a male hustler, a type of character he had long celebrated in his work. Though some may find it daunting, Schwartz's prodigious research lucidly shows how Pasolini's primordial ... preconscious link between politics and sexuality manifested itself as he avoided Fascism, sought an individualistic communism and used the nourishment of scorn to push himself to intellectual clarity. Pasolini wrote stories of the poor as he focused on postwar Rome, but in the 1960s he saw the burgeoning Italian cinema as the most powerful medium in which to represent reality. The subject of 33 legal actions against his writing and films, Pasolini became most famous for being scandalous, but Schwartz shows how explicit films such as Decameron (a surprise 1971 hit in the U.S.) grew out of the auteur's moral and political obsessions. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.This much-needed biography of one of modern Italy's towering intellectual figures combines vital data, refresher glimpses at recent Italian history, and analysis of public reaction to his many gadfly polemics. During the 30 years of his productive life, this "reactionary of the Left" was in the spotlight; whether as poet, critic, filmmaker, or novelist, his message was not to console. Thus, in his film Salo , members of the haute monde dine on their own excrement; Pasolini is telling us in his inimitable way that consumer society will end up consuming the fruit of its own uselessness. An unwavering homosexual taken to court 33 times yet never found guilty, Pasolini had typically complex views on homosexuality. Probably because he needed alienation to be creative, he had no interest in organizations to promote individual liberation. Schwartz starts the book with the gripping details of Pasolini's murder and at the finale returns to chronicle the tragic recidivism of the 17-year-old murderer.

Now, armed with a fly-fishing rod and reel, he embarks with his seven-year-old daughter on an equally memorable journey across America in search of clear-running streams, swift elusive fish, and the eternal truths that only nature can provide.<br><br>It has been said that life is what happens while you're waiting to go fishing. Only weeks after his eleven-year marriage abruptly ended in an amicable divorce, James Dodson decided to go on a fly-fishing pilgrimage west. His goal: to heal his wounded spirit and explain as best he could the vagaries of life and love to his beautiful, precocious seven-year-old daughter, Maggie.<br><br>With his beat-up truck, Old Blue, and his aging retriever, Amos, Dodson and Maggie travel without plans or reservations, following where the spirit--and the lure of America's mighty rivers--leads them, on their way to one of America's grandest treasures: Yellowstone National Park. On the way, Dodson discovers a great deal about fishing, about America, and about the special relationship that exists only between a father and daughter. <br><br>They travel from the Adirondacks, once a fly-angler's haven, to the mist-shrouded Niagara Falls. From the Michigan lakes where Ernest Hemingway roamed as a boy to small-town county fairs. From the majesty of Mount Rushmore to the mysticism of Harney's Peak, where Black Elk had his legendary visions, to finally the fly-fisherman's paradise of the San Juan River. Together father and daughter are bound by a tie as resilient and unpredictable as a fly-fisherman's line. For as the emotional waters in which they fish become ever more turbulent, Maggie's unspoken feelings of grief, anger, and blame begin to surface--a depth of hurt that forces Dodson to face his own unacknowledged pain and, worse, leaves him feeling helpless to make everything all right in his daughter's life again. <br><br>Yet if fly-fishing has taught James Dodson anything, it is the rewards of patience, of following the wisdom of the course of the stream, the unexpected revelations reflected in still pools, and, of course, an abiding belief in plain dumb luck. With a little of each, these faithful travelers will find their way home again.<br><br>Literate, honest, and deeply observant, <i>Faithful Travelers</i> is a beautiful meditation on the bond between parent and child and the nature of love and loss. In <i>Faithful Travelers,</i> James Dodson proves that sometimes life isn't what happens while you're waiting to go fishing: sometimes it happens while you're there.</p><p>James Dodson is a regular columnist for <i>Golf</i> magazine and an editor of <i>Departures</i> magazine.

I'd been calmly driving for two hours, alternately chatting with my daughter about this and that and then being left alone to angle in the quiet rivers of my own thoughts, still vaguely trying to sort out some kind of reasonable itinerary. I was feeling slightly better and Maggie, displaying the faith of a mustard seed, seemed downright thrilled to be headed God knows where after trout.<br><br>She asked if we could stop and fish the Connecticut and I replied that we couldn't because I hoped to make the banks of the Green instead before dusk. It was only a few miles ahead and I even knew a place we might pitch camp.<br><br>"What's the Green?"<br><br>"A river. The place I learned to fly-cast by verse."<br><br>"Did Granddaddy teach you to fish there?"<br><br>"No. He taught me to spin-fish in North Carolina. Fly-fishing is something I picked up much later. Spin-casting and fly-fishing are entirely different, Mugs. Sort of like hockey compared to figure skating."<br><br>"Who taught you to fly-fish?"<br><br>I smiled at the image of his face.<br><br>"Funny old guy. Just somebody I met when I first came to Vermont." A moment more and I recalled his oddly apt nickname. "Saint Cecil."<br><br>"Was he really a saint?" We'd recently read a book about Saint Francis.<br><br>"No. Just a retired college professor. A devoted dry-fly man."<br><br>"Tell me," she said, and crossed her bare legs Indian style on the seat, anticipating the tale.<br><br>I had six weeks and nothing better to do. So I told her. "As I frequently used to say to my overly serious first-year students at seminary, naked cameth I into this world and naked I shall surely leave it, except perhaps for the Hardy Brothers split-cane fly rod and a couple Royal Coachmen and the odd brookie in my creel. My little funny was meant to loosen them up, prepare them for a life that takes itself much too seriously, though I'm afraid it seldom had the desired effect. <i>The Lord loves a good joke, you know.</i> That's what I used to say. <i>Except those we see fit to elect to higher office.</i>"<br><br>The speaker was a powerful-looking man in his late sixties, bullnecked, sun-wrinkled, his bristly hair gone the color of new snow. He had a small audience of attractive young women drinking white wine.<br><br>"That's Saint Cecil," Dorothy whispered to me, "my late aunt Edna's husband, an old lefty preacher who's positively mad for fly-fishing. He used to teach New Testament at some Bible college down South until they ran him off. Not shy for opinions on any subject, I'm afraid. He and my aunt always came for the Bach festival in Marlboro and he's just kept coming. He'll be underfoot here at least a week." She issued a small tragic sigh, then glanced at me. I was her new tenant, having just signed the lease on the small wood-heated house she owned on the banks of Vermont's Green River. "You're from the South. I nearly forgot. <i>Please</i> tell me you adore trout fishing."<br><br>I hated to disappoint her, but she seized my arm and dragged me over to meet her uncle regardless. He threw his hand at me like a punch and nearly fractured a couple knuckles squeezing my hand.<br><br>"I know why I'm here," he declared with a booming Alabama drawl, "to soak up the two-hunnerd-year-old strains of a Leipzig choirmaster and chase <i>truite de mer.</i> That's French Canadian for eastern brook trout. Question is, why the hell are you so far from home?"<br><br>It wasn't a question I was fully prepared to answer. I didn't wish to tell him I'd run away from home at age thirty, so I smiled and mumbled something polite about taking a year off from my journalism career, a hiatus, a much-needed sabbatical before I resumed interviewing politicians and murder suspects for my magazines.<br><br>"Reporter, eh?" The revelation seemed to annoy him. "Do you fly-fish?"<br><br>I said no and explained that I used to bass-fish with spinner bait but I mostly played golf now.<br><br>"Golf's a splendid game for old men," he agreed, lowering the tide in his wineglass by half with one swallow. "Tell you what. I've got several rods with me. I'll be by and pick you up at dawn and we'll spend the day on the water. Put a whole new perspective on the situation, fly angling. I'm a dry-fly man, myself. You can keep your sinking nymphs and blast your emergers. Dry angling, in my view, is to fishing what free will is to any intelligent discussion of religion. The fun comes from the damned difficulty, you see?" He finished off his wine with a fierce gulp.<br><br>I nodded dumbly, wondering whether we were talking about faith or fishing. It appeared useless to protest that I knew absolutely zilch about the art of fly-fishing. Saint Cecil slapped me on the shoulder hard enough to loosen a filling, barked something about wearing shoes I could get wet, and wandered away to harass a nice couple just up from the Berkshires who were thinking of opening an organic grocery store in the village.<br><br>We spent three days climbing in and out of the swift shallow currents of the Green River together, talking a little about religion and a lot about fly-fishing. Uncle Cecil was impressed I knew a little bit about the Gospels and even more pleased to have a complete fly novice to abuse on the water. The Green is a pretty, winding river in southeast Vermont, but not on a par with the state's justly famous trout streams like the Battenkill or Mad. Over three days I learned how to tie double blood knots and needle knots and how, in order to assure a good presentation of the fly, the leader must roll out "sweet as a Bach cantata" over the water. Fly-fishing was a study in natural deception, Saint Cecil said, pointing out that the world's first great fly angler had been a trout-crazy nun from a priory in Hertfordshire. Among other indispensable tidbits, I learned that Plutarch had strongly advocated using stallion hair in tied flies and that fishhooks had been found in the ancient River Euphrates. "Possibly belonged to old Adam himself. That's the location of the Garden of Eden, you know. Crack dry-fly angler."<br><br>As we stood calf-deep in the freezing stream (I was wearing gym shorts and leather boat shoes), he ran through his personal repertoire of fly casts--basic overhead cast (eleven o'clock to four), back and roll casts, false casts, the art of shooting line, double hauling--then stood back and glared with amused disgust as I repeatedly snarled my line and tied myself up in wind knots. "It won't work worth a damn to try to <i>bludgeon</i> the fish to death," he shouted helpfully at me from a distance. "Slow that rod down, sport. Nice and easy. Stroke the air. Know any poetry?"<br><br>Through gritted teeth I admitted that I knew a few lines of a few poems.<br><br>"Excellent. Pick a stanza and recite it aloud as you make your cast. That little trick may help. Nice and slow, less wrist, and let it go."<br><br>Self-conscious in the extreme, I recited a few lines from Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." <i>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,</i> I said, <i>But I have promises to keep--</i>I truly hated being called "sport" but the trick worked and I started to get the hang of it--<i>And miles to go before I sleep--</i>developing not quite a skill but something perhaps faintly resembling a skill--<i>And miles to go before I sleep.</i> I learned, too, about damsel nymphs and stone flies, great diving beetles and water boatmen, how to scour the water lines and "match the hatch," how to strip line, tie on more tippet, debarb my hook, pinch my line.<br><br>"Interesting poem," Saint Cecil thundered at me as we left the water. "Frost wrote those lines when he was in deep depression, contemplating suicide. What a miserable sod."<br><br>I guess I'd known this, I said. Or maybe not.<br><br>"You a Scotch man?"<br><br>I didn't care for Scotch but it seemed impolite to say no. He opened a pint of Highland malt and we sat on the bank for a while taking small nips of Scotch from Dixie cups he kept in his beaten-up willow creel.<br><br>"Which gospel is your favorite?"<br><br>I was startled by the bluntness of his question but probably shouldn't have been. I sputtered "Matthew," not really knowing Matthew but recalling that it was the only gospel I'd read completely from beginning to end. I'd read parts of the other Gospels but at that point in my life reading the Bible didn't rate high on my list.<br><br>"Matthew, eh?&nbsp;&nbsp;Bit florid for my tastes. Grossly embellished the whole business about the resurrection and virgin birth, you know. Mark was a much more reliable journalist. Leaves a bit to the imagination. That's the point of a good mystery story, you know--to keep you asking the right questions. People want easy answers, and that's the Almighty's wily joke on us--there <i>aren't</i> any. Salvation is a little like dry-fly fishing that way: You've got to do the work to catch the fish. Always thought it was clever of Christ to pick <i>fishermen</i> for his sidekicks. Natural-born storytellers. Hate to let <i>any</i> fish get away."<br><br>We talked further and I learned, among other things, that Uncle Cecil had been a navy cook at Okinawa during the war and had marched, against the advice of some of his colleagues, with civil rights groups in Memphis and Detroit in the sixties. A bit like the prophet Amos, he thought the church establishment was going to hell in a handbasket--more interested in building steeples than saving souls--and that Ronald Reagan and his "stooge" James Watt (then secretary of the interior) were criminal phonies who were destroying the environment and ruining America's best trout streams. Cecil said the sound of a clean-running trout stream was living poetry, a symphony in the wild--"Trout Music." And he had fished almost everywhere: for steelheads in the Boundary Waters and wild browns in Yorkshire, Scotland's Doon, and Henry's Fork in southeastern Idaho; chased salmon through the mouth of the Columbia. When I asked him his favorite place of all, he thought for an instant and replied, "Montana's good--the upper Yellowstone particularly, absolutely stunning country, though it's getting too damned crowded with well-dressed fishermen. The Snake's excellent, or used to be; haven't been there in a while. There's a canyon below the dam on the San Juan, though--that's in northern New Mexico, just as the river runs out of the Colorado Rockies. The trout are big as your arm and damned wise. All catch-and-release. Beautiful fish, gorgeous water. Edna and I were out there for a week a couple years back. She painted landscapes and I fished. A living cathedral. Real Trout Music."<br><br>I liked that. Trout Music.<br><br>We went back in the river and fished in silence. "Above all else," he mused a while later, pausing to snip a sodden fly off his line, "the thing you never want to do is outlive your beloved. Avoid that fate, son, if at all possible." His wife had been dead for two years. Just after he said this, Saint Cecil caught a nice brook trout large enough to keep, but wet his hands and released the fish back to the stream. I finally caught a trout, too, a small one, its pale pink gills pumping. He showed me how to remove the hook with forceps and cradle the fish in the water, facing the trout upstream so oxygen could quickly revive him.<br><br>On our last afternoon together, he brought me a small book called <i>A River Never Sleeps,</i> by Roderick Haig-Brown, told me to keep it awhile and read it, then send it back to him in Alabama or he'd come hunt me down like a mangy yellow dog. He suggested that I read the Book of Mark, too, if I knew what was good for me; learn to ask the right question rather than seek the answer--with a little luck, one would lead to the other; and for God's sake keep my wrist out of the cast. I gave him back his loaner fly rod and we shook hands. The man could break your fingers.<br><br>I read his book and sent it back but I never saw Saint Cecil again. I bought the cheapest fly rod Orvis offered and fished the Green and other area rivers off and on for the next year. During that time I became very good at golf and fairly respectable at presenting my fly to <i>truite de mer,</i> though nowhere near in my teacher's class. I caught a few trout and let most of them go. I got a yellow pup to keep me company in streams and named him Amos, after the Old Testament prophet who thought the world was going to hell in a handbasket.</p><h2>Aircraft Accident Investigation, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Covers all aspects of aircraft accident investigations.

Author Samuel Terrien has lived in the Holy Land and studied archaeology at the French School in Jerusalem. Dr. Terrien writes of the Hebrews&#39; migration from the Tigris-Euphrates valley, of their bondage in Egypt, and of the founding of Israel and the kingdoms of David and Solomon. The narrative continues with the Babylonian captivity, the Greek invasion of Palestine, the Roman occupation during Jesus&#39; lifetime and on up into the present times.

Led by such champions as Columbus, Ponce de Leon, and Hernandez Cortes, the Spanish established a stranglehold on the exportable wealth of the New World, which was gradually eroded by such diverse foes as Francis Drake, Piet Heyn (the Dutch admiral who captured an entire Spanish treasure fleet) Henry Morgan, and Blackbeard. The Funnel of Gold, a spell-binding chronicle of this prolonged clash, combines the sweep of history with the dynamism of human adventure. Many obstacles hampered the Spanish monopolization of the riches of the New World: virulent disease; primitive navigational instruments; cumbersome ships; devastating hurricanes; treacherous coral reefs, pirates, both male and female; and the naval might of England, France, and the Netherlands. Mendel Peterson connects the fierce rivalry of the major European powers for control of the New World to their jockeying for power on the Continent and the religious upheaval of the time. Ironically, the unbending fervor with which the Spanish throne sought to secure its grip on Caribbean riches contributed to the dissolution of Spain&#39;s empire, which by 1825 had shrunk to Cuba and Puerto Rico. As a stirring re-creation of dramatic tableaux and as a historical document of this era, The Funnel of Gold is unsurpassed. The use of actual words of participants in the fantastic events described, unprecedented in works such as this, heightens the color and authenticity of the account. More than 140 illustrations and four useful maps complement the text.</p><p></p><h2>Find a Victim</h2><p>Sept. 1984 Bantam mass market paperback, Ross MacDonald (The Chill).

But now things are splintering apart, for one reason, it seems: Edie&#39;s enormous girth. She&#39;s obsessed with food--thinking about it, eating it--and if she doesn&#39;t stop, she won&#39;t have much longer to live. When Richard abandons his wife, it is up to the next generation to take control. Robin, their schoolteacher daughter, is determined that her father pay for leaving Edie. Benny, an easy-going, pot-smoking family man, just wants to smooth things over. And Rachelle-- a whippet thin perfectionist-- is intent on saving her mother-in-law&#39;s life, but this task proves even bigger than planning her twin children&#39;s spectacular b&#39;nai mitzvah party. Through it all, they wonder: do Edie&#39;s devastating choices rest on her shoulders alone, or are others at fault, too?With pitch-perfect prose, huge compassion, and sly humor, Jami Attenberg has given us an epic story of</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2012:</strong> At five years old, Edie already tipped 62 pounds. She&#x2019;d clearly &#x201c;surpassed luscious,&#x201d; but how could her lioness of a mother--or her father, who&#x2019;d starved all the way from Ukraine to Chicago, and so also felt &#x201c;carnal, primal, about food&#x201d;--resist feeding her? They all believed that &#x201c;food was made of love ... and they could never deny themselves a bit of anything they desired.&#x201d; So Edie indulged for decades, expanding finally to 350 pounds, discovering (when Richard, her husband of 30 years, gave up trying to stop her and moved out) that food is &#x201c;a wonderful place to hide.&#x201d; Her adult children&#x2019;s extravagant worry--mounting with each diabetic surgery and undistracted by her grandchildren&#x2019;s choreographed, chocolate fountained <em>b&#x2019;nai mitzvah</em> preparations--do nothing to dampen Edie&#x2019;s enthusiasm to consume, and Attenberg describes Edie&#x2019;s meals with a sensual relish that could verge on repulsive if it didn&#x2019;t so readily trigger our own desires. The same story told with less compassionate humor could have easily been distasteful, but <em>The Middlesteins</em> has a light, tragicomic touch that lends it unexpectedly poignant heft. &#x2013;<em>Mari Malcolm</em>Jami Attenberg is the author of a story collection, <em>Instant Love</em>, and two novels, <em>The Kept Man</em> and <em>The Melting Season</em>.

Kalpa Imperial is much more than a simple political allegory or fable. It is also a celebration of the power of storytelling.

His sister, Annie, was standing by his bed. <br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; he asked. <br> &#x201c;I heard a weird sound outside,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;And guess what I saw!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; said Jack. <br> &#x201c;An eagle!&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;A <i>huge</i> eagle. It was sitting on top of the lamppost in our yard.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;No way,&#x201d; said Jack. <br> &#x201c;Yes, way,&#x201d; said Annie. <br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet Morgan sent him.&#x201d; <br> Jack sat up in bed. He threw off his covers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming!&#x201d; he said. <br> &#x201c;Hurry. We have to get back home before Mom and Dad get up. Meet you on the porch.&#x201d; Annie slipped out of the room. <br> Jack climbed out of bed. He changed into his jeans, sweatshirt, and sneakers. He grabbed his backpack. Then he crept downstairs and went out to the front porch. <br> Annie was waiting in the chilly, damp air. Dawn was breaking. <br> &#x201c;There!&#x201d; she whispered. She pointed toward the lamppost in front of their house. <br> An eagle was perched on top. He was dark brown, except for a ring of golden-brown feathers around his neck. He stared at them with piercing eyes. <br> &#x201c;Oh, man, that&#x2019;s a golden eagle,&#x201d; whispered Jack. <br> The eagle spread his wings. He rose into the early-morning sky and flew toward the woods. <br> &#x201c;Follow him!&#x201d; said Jack. <br> Jack and Annie ran down the porch steps. They crossed their yard and dashed down the sidewalk after the eagle. <br> &#x201c;There!&#x201d; said Annie, looking up. She pointed to the bird gliding above the Frog Creek woods. <br> Jack and Annie crossed the street. They hurried between the shadowy trees, until they came to the tallest oak. <br> &#x201c;Whoa!&#x201d; said Jack. <br> The eagle was perched on the roof of the magic tree house. <br> &#x201c;Yay!&#x201d; said Annie. <br> &#x201c;You were right!&#x201d; said Jack. <br> They climbed up the rope ladder and into the tree house. <br> Sunlight streamed onto the floor. It shined on two small wooden tablets. Next to the tablets was a scroll. <br> &#x201c;A message from Morgan!&#x201d; said Annie. She unrolled the scroll and read: <br> <i><br>Land by the Danube </i><br> <i>Many years ago. </i><br> <i>Find a Roman legion camp </i><br> <i>Dusted with snow. </i><br><br>&#x201c;A <i>Roman legion camp</i>?&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a legion?&#x201d; said Annie. <br> &#x201c;A legion is a unit in the ancient Roman army,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;A legion had almost six thousand warriors. The whole army had around 150,000 warriors. And&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Okay, got it,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;And what&#x2019;s the Danube?&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a river that ran along the border of the Roman empire,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;That was almost two thousand years ago.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;How do you know all this?&#x201d; said Annie. <br> &#x201c;My school project on the Roman army,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;Remember that model of a camp I made? And I had to explain it to my class.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Oh, yeah, I remember,&#x201d; said Annie. <br> &#x201c;Rome had the best warriors in the world,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;They defended the Roman empire for over five hundred years! They&#x2014;&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Great, got it,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s more here from Morgan.&#x201d; She read from the scroll again: <br><br> <i>You must each keep a journal. </i><br> <i>Use tablets of wax. </i><br> <i>With a pen called a stylus, </i><br> <i>Write down the facts. <br></i><br> &#x201c;So that&#x2019;s what <i>this</i> is!&#x201d; said Jack. He grabbed one of the wooden tablets. &#x201c;In ancient times, people wrote on these. See, the wood&#x2019;s covered with wax.&#x201d; He picked up a pointed reed. &#x201c;And here&#x2019;s the stylus! It&#x2019;s like a pen with no ink!&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;Listen to this.&#x201d; <br><br> <i>Write what you see. </i><br> <i>Write what you feel. </i><br> <i>Do what warriors do </i><br> <i>To make your words real. <br></i><br> &#x201c;How do we &#x2018;do what warriors do&#x2019;?&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;Roman warriors were the toughest guys on the planet. They had years of training.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Maybe Morgan sent us something to give us magic skills,&#x201d; said Annie, &#x201c;like the baseball caps we wore to be major league batboys.&#x201d; <br> They looked in the shadowy corners of the tree house. Jack saw only the Pennsylvania book that would bring them home. <br> &#x201c;Nothing here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Morgan didn&#x2019;t even send a research book to help us.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, you know a lot from your project,&#x201d; said Annie. <br> &#x201c;Not <i>enough</i>,&#x201d; said Jack. <br> &#x201c;Well, maybe Morgan wants us to learn more on our own,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;Last verse.&#x201d; <br><br> <i>Give the silver coin </i><br> <i>To a hero in disguise. </i><br> <i>He will share with you his wisdom. </i><br> <i>Be home by moonrise. <br></i><br> &#x201c;What silver coin?&#x201d; said Annie. <br> They looked around the tree house again. Jack spotted a black coin on the floor. It was about the size of a quarter. <br> &#x201c;Maybe this?&#x201d; he said, picking it up. <br> &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t look like silver,&#x201d; said Annie. <br> &#x201c;Silver turns dark over time,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;You have to polish it.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Okay, we can do that later. Let&#x2019;s go now!&#x201d; said Annie. <br> &#x201c;How?&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no research book to take us to the right place.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Hmm . . . ,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;I have an idea. I&#x2019;ll just point at Morgan&#x2019;s words.&#x201d; She touched the rhyme. &#x201c;I wish we could go to a <i>Roman legion camp</i> on the <i>Danube</i>!&#x201d; <br> A cry from the eagle pierced the air. <br> The wind started to blow. <br> The tree house started to spin. <br> It spun faster and faster. <br> Then everything was still. <br> Absolutely still.</p>
